            "overview": "The pharmacokinetics of amifampridine is approximately dose proportional. Steady state was generally reached within 1 day of dosing. Multiple dosing resulted in no accumulation of amifampridine and only moderate accumulation of the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite.",
            "absorption": "The absolute bioavailability of RUZURGI has not been assessed. RUZURGI is absorbed in an approximately dose-proportional manner with a median time to maximum concentration (t max ) of 0.5 hours post administration. Food: Compared to administration of RUZURGI in the fasting state, administration of the 20 and 30 mg dose levels of RUZURGI with a standard high fat meal resulted in significant decrease in C max (41% and 52%, respectively) and an increase in median t max to 1.0 hour; AUC 0-last was only significantly reduced for the 30 mg dose (23%).", 
            "distribution": "In healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution for plasma amifampridine indicated that RUZURGI is a drug with a moderate to high volume of distribution. In vitro human plasma protein binding of amifampridine and 3-N-acetyl amifampridine was 25.3% and 43.3%, respectively.", 
            "elimination": "Metabolism: In vitro studies with complimentary DNA expressed human N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme preparations indicate that amifampridine is rapidly metabolized by the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme to the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite. Metabolism of amifampridine by N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) may also occur but at a much slower rate. Amifampridine does not undergo glucuronidation or sulfonation. Excretion: Following oral administration of a single 20 or 30 mg dose of RUZURGI to healthy volunteers, amifampridine apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 149 to 214 L/h, the average elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 3.6 to 4.2 hours. The average t 1/2 of the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite was 4.1 to 4.8 hours. The majority (>65%) of RUZURGI administered to healthy volunteers was recovered in urine as either the parent compound or the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite.",
            "special_populations": "Pediatric Patients (6 to Less than 17 Years of Age): A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight significantly correlates with the clearance of amifampridine; clearance increased with an increase in body weight. A weight-based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve amifampridine exposures in pediatric patients 6 to less than 17 years of age similar to those observed in adults at effective doses of RUZURGI.",
            "ddi_studies": "In vitro studies: Amifampridine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that amifampridine and 3-N-acetyl amifampridine were not direct or time-dependent inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4. In vitro studies in cryopreserved human hepatocytes indicated that amifampridine did not induce CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Based on in vitro studies with Caco-2 cells amifampridine is unlikely to act as a substrate or inhibitor of the P glycoprotein transporter. Amifampridine is not an inhibitor of the BCRP transporter. In vitro studies with Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OCT2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing human OAT3 indicated that amifampridine is a weak inhibitor of OCT2, but is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. The studies also indicated that amifampridine is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 transporters. In vivo studies: Controlled clinical drug interaction studies have not been performed with RUZURGI. Co-administration of intravenous amifampridine and intravenous pyridostigmine led to a 21% elevation in maximum pyridostigmine serum concentrations, but did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of amifampridine."
