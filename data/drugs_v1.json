            "overview": "The pharmacokinetics of amifampridine is approximately dose proportional. Steady state was generally reached within 1 day of dosing. Multiple dosing resulted in no accumulation of amifampridine and only moderate accumulation of the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite.",
            "absorption": "The absolute bioavailability of RUZURGI has not been assessed. RUZURGI is absorbed in an approximately dose-proportional manner with a median time to maximum concentration (t max ) of 0.5 hours post administration. Food: Compared to administration of RUZURGI in the fasting state, administration of the 20 and 30 mg dose levels of RUZURGI with a standard high fat meal resulted in significant decrease in C max (41% and 52%, respectively) and an increase in median t max to 1.0 hour; AUC 0-last was only significantly reduced for the 30 mg dose (23%).", 
            "distribution": "In healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution for plasma amifampridine indicated that RUZURGI is a drug with a moderate to high volume of distribution. In vitro human plasma protein binding of amifampridine and 3-N-acetyl amifampridine was 25.3% and 43.3%, respectively.", 
            "elimination": "metabolism: In vitro studies with complimentary DNA expressed human N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzyme preparations indicate that amifampridine is rapidly metabolized by the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme to the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite. Metabolism of amifampridine by N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) may also occur but at a much slower rate. Amifampridine does not undergo glucuronidation or sulfonation. Excretion: Following oral administration of a single 20 or 30 mg dose of RUZURGI to healthy volunteers, amifampridine apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 149 to 214 L/h, the average elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) was 3.6 to 4.2 hours. The average t 1/2 of the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite was 4.1 to 4.8 hours. The majority (>65%) of RUZURGI administered to healthy volunteers was recovered in urine as either the parent compound or the 3-N-acetyl amifampridine metabolite.",
            "special_populations": "Pediatric Patients (6 to Less than 17 Years of Age): A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that body weight significantly correlates with the clearance of amifampridine; clearance increased with an increase in body weight. A weight-based dosing regimen is necessary to achieve amifampridine exposures in pediatric patients 6 to less than 17 years of age similar to those observed in adults at effective doses of RUZURGI.",
            "ddi_studies": "In vitro studies: Amifampridine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes indicated that amifampridine and 3-N-acetyl amifampridine were not direct or time-dependent inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4. In vitro studies in cryopreserved human hepatocytes indicated that amifampridine did not induce CYP isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Based on in vitro studies with Caco-2 cells amifampridine is unlikely to act as a substrate or inhibitor of the P glycoprotein transporter. Amifampridine is not an inhibitor of the BCRP transporter. In vitro studies with Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OCT2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing human OAT3 indicated that amifampridine is a weak inhibitor of OCT2, but is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3. The studies also indicated that amifampridine is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2 transporters. <strong> In vivo studies </strong> Controlled clinical drug interaction studies have not been performed with RUZURGI. Co-administration of intravenous amifampridine and intravenous pyridostigmine led to a 21% elevation in maximum pyridostigmine serum concentrations, but did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of amifampridine."

The mean elimination half-lives are about 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. At steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole are dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that ABILIFY DISCMELT Orally Disintegrating Tablets are bioequivalent to ABILIFY Tablets.",
            "absorption": "Tablet: Aripiprazole is well absorbed after administration of the tablet, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3 hours to 5 hours; the absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87%. ABILIFY can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 15 mg ABILIFY Tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the Cmax or AUC of aripiprazole or its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, but delayed Tmax by 3 hours for aripiprazole and 12 hours for dehydroaripiprazole. Oral Solution: Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole from the solution were higher than that from the tablet formulation. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to tablet ratios of geometric mean Cmax and AUC values were 122% and 114%, respectively [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.6)]. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional between the doses of 5 mg to 30 mg.",
            "distribution": "The steady-state volume of distribution of aripiprazole following intravenous administration is high (404 L or 4.9 L/kg), indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered 0.5 to 30 mg/day aripiprazole for 14 days, there was dose-dependent D2 receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans.",
            "elimination": "Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, dehydroaripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma. Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately 25% and 55% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces.",

Based on simulation, a 4.5-fold increase in mean Cmax and AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. A 3-fold increase in mean Cmax and AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.figure 1 figure 2 The effects of ABILIFY on the exposures of other drugs are summarized in Figure 3. A population PK analysis in patients with major depressive disorder showed no substantial change in plasma concentrations of fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg/day), paroxetine CR (37.5 or 50 mg/day), or sertraline (100 or 150 mg/day) dosed to steady-state. The steady-state plasma concentrations of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine increased by about 18% and 36%, respectively, and concentrations of paroxetine decreased by about 27%. The steady-state plasma concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were not substantially changed when these antidepressant therapies were coadministered with aripiprazole. figure 3 INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION: In two pharmacokinetic studies of aripiprazole injection administered intramuscularly to healthy subjects, the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were at 1 hour and 3 hours. A 5 mg intramuscular injection of aripiprazole had an absolute bioavailability of 100%. The geometric mean maximum concentration achieved after an intramuscular dose was on average 19% higher than the Cmax of the oral tablet. While the systemic exposure over 24 hours was generally similar between aripiprazole injection given intramuscularly and after oral tablet administration, the aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet. In stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole after intramuscular administration were linear over a dose range of 1 mg to 45 mg. Although the metabolism of aripiprazole injection was not systematically evaluated, the intramuscular route of administration would not be expected to alter the metabolic pathways."

Maximum daily dose 30 mg (2.5) 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults Dose Selection: The recommended starting and target dose for ABILIFY is 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. ABILIFY has been systematically evaluated and shown to be effective in a dose range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day, when administered as the tablet formulation; however, doses higher than 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day were not more effective than 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day. Dosage increases should generally not be made before 2 weeks, the time needed to achieve steady-state. Maintenance Treatment: Maintenance of efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a trial involving patients with schizophrenia who had been symptomatically stable on other antipsychotic medications for periods of 3 months or longer. These patients were discontinued from those medications and randomized to either ABILIFY 15 mg/day or placebo, and observed for relapse. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. Adolescents Dose Selection: The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 10 mg/day. Aripiprazole was studied in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia at daily doses of 10 mg and 30 mg. The starting daily dose of the tablet formulation in these patients was 2 mg, which was titrated to 5 mg after 2 days and to the target dose of 10 mg after 2 additional days. Subsequent dose increases should be administered in 5 mg increments. The 30 mg/day dose was not shown to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. ABILIFY can be administered without regard to meals. Maintenance Treatment: The efficacy of ABILIFY for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in the adolescent population has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the adolescent patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained on the drug, maintenance efficacy can be extrapolated from adult data along with comparisons of aripiprazole pharmacokinetic parameters in adult and pediatric patients. Thus, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response, but at the lowest dose needed to maintain remission. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients with schizophrenia from other antipsychotics to ABILIFY or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. 2.2 Bipolar I Disorder Acute Treatment of Manic and Mixed Episodes Adults: The recommended starting dose in adults is 15 mg given once daily as monotherapy and 10 mg to 15 mg given once daily as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. ABILIFY can be given without regard to meals. The recommended target dose of ABILIFY is 15 mg/day, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. The dose may be increased to 30 mg/day based on clinical response. Pediatrics: The recommended starting dose in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) as monotherapy is 2 mg/day, with titration to 5 mg/day after 2 days, and a target dose of 10 mg/day after 2 additional days. Recommended dosing as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate is the same. Maintenance Treatment The recommended dose for maintenance treatment, whether as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, is the same dose needed to stabilize patients during acute treatment, both for adult and pediatric patients. 2.3 Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder Adults Dose Selection: The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY as adjunctive treatment for patients already taking an antidepressant is 2 mg/day to 5 mg/day. The efficacy of ABILIFY as an adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder was established within a dose range of 2 mg/day to 15 mg/day. Maintenance Treatment: The efficacy of ABILIFY for the adjunctive maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. 2.4 Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder Pediatric Patients Dose Selection: The efficacy of aripiprazole has been established in the treatment of pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with irritability associated with autistic disorder at doses of 5 mg/day to 15 mg/day. The dosage of ABILIFY should be individualized according to tolerability and response. Dosing should be initiated at 2 mg/day. The dose should be increased to 5 mg/day, with subsequent increases to 10 mg/day or 15 mg/day if needed. Maintenance Treatment: The efficacy of ABILIFY for the maintenance treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with ABILIFY should be maintained, patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. 2.5 Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Mania (Intramuscular Injection) Adults Dose Selection: The recommended dose in these patients is 9.75 mg. The effectiveness of aripiprazole injection in controlling agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar mania was demonstrated over a dose range of 5.25 mg to 15 mg. No additional benefit was demonstrated for 15 mg compared to 9.75 mg. A lower dose of 5.25 mg may be considered when clinical factors warrant. If agitation warranting a second dose persists following the initial dose, cumulative doses up to a total of 30 mg/day may be given. However, the efficacy of repeated doses of aripiprazole injection in agitated patients has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The safety of total daily doses greater than 30 mg or injections given more frequently than every 2 hours have not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14.5) ] . If ongoing aripiprazole therapy is clinically indicated, oral aripiprazole in a range of 10 mg/day to 30 mg/day should replace aripiprazole injection as soon as possible [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1 and 2.2) ] . Administration of ABILIFY Injection To administer ABILIFY Injection, draw up the required volume of solution into the syringe as shown in Table 1. Discard any unused portion. Table 1: ABILIFY Injection Dosing Recommendations Single-Dose Required Volume of Solution 5.25 mg 0.7 mL 9.75 mg 1.3 mL 15 mg 2 mL ABILIFY Injection is intended for intramuscular use only. Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously. Inject slowly, deep into the muscle mass. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.6 Dosage Adjustment Dosage adjustments in adults are not routinely indicated on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal or hepatic impairment status. When adjunctive ABILIFY is administered to patients with major depressive disorder, ABILIFY should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) . Dosing of Oral Solution The oral solution can be substituted for tablets on a mg-per-mg basis up to the 25 mg dose level. Patients receiving 30 mg tablets should receive 25 mg of the solution. 2.8 Dosing of Orally Disintegrating Tablets The dosing for ABILIFY Orally Disintegrating Tablets is the same as for the oral tablets.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "ARISTADA is a prodrug of aripiprazole and its activity is primarily due to aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent dehydro-aripiprazole (major metabolite of aripiprazole), which has been shown to have affinities for D 2 receptors similar to aripiprazole and represents 30-40% of the aripiprazole exposure in plasma. Absorption After single intramuscular injection the appearance of aripiprazole in the systemic circulation starts from 5 to 6 days and continues to be released for an additional 36 days. Aripiprazole concentrations increase with consecutive doses of ARISTADA and reach steady-state four months following treatment initiation. The concentration-time course of dehydro-aripiprazole followed that of aripiprazole. With the addition of a single intramuscular injection of ARISTADA INITIO and 30 mg oral aripiprazole at the time of the first ARISTADA dose, aripiprazole concentrations reach relevant levels within 4 days. Similarly, with the addition of the oral supplementation for 21 days at the time of the first ARISTADA dose, aripiprazole concentrations reach relevant levels within 4 days. Aripiprazole exposure was similar for deltoid and gluteal intramuscular injections of 441 mg ARISTADA, thus are interchangeable. Administration of 882 mg every 6 weeks or 1064 mg every 2 months results in plasma aripiprazole concentrations that were similar to exposure with 662 mg monthly and are within the range provided by doses of 441 mg monthly and 882 mg monthly. The doses of 441 mg monthly and 882 monthly showed a similar clinical response to each other. Distribution Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of aripiprazole following intramuscular injection of ARISTADA was 268 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution following absorption. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and its major metabolite are greater than 99% bound to serum proteins, primarily to albumin. In healthy human volunteers administered 0.5 mg/day to 30 mg/day oral aripiprazole for 14 days, there was dose-dependent D 2 receptor occupancy indicating brain penetration of aripiprazole in humans. Elimination Metabolism The biotransformation of ARISTADA likely involves enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to form N-hydroxymethyl-aripiprazole, which subsequently undergoes hydrolysis to aripiprazole. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Excretion The mean aripiprazole terminal elimination half-life ranged from 53.9 days to 57.2 days after monthly, every 6-week and every 2 month injections of ARISTADA. The significantly longer aripiprazole apparent half-life compared to oral aripiprazole (mean 75 hours) is attributed to the dissolution and formation rate-limited elimination of aripiprazole following ARISTADA administration. Drug Interaction Studies No specific drug interaction studies have been performed with ARISTADA. The drug interaction data provided below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. Effects of other drugs on the exposures of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 2 , respectively. Based on simulation, a 4.5-fold increase in mean C max and AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. After oral administration, a 3-fold increase in mean C max and AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

        "dosage": "Administer ARISTADA by intramuscular injection in the deltoid (441 mg dose only) or gluteal (441 mg, 662 mg, 882 mg or 1064 mg) muscle by a healthcare professional ( 2.1 ). For patients naïve to aripiprazole, establish tolerability with oral aripiprazole prior to initiating treatment with ARISTADA ( 2.1 ). There are two options for initiating treatment with ARISTADA: Option #1: Administer one injection of 675 mg of ARISTADA INITIO ® and one 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole in conjunction with the first ARISTADA injection. ( 2.1 ). Option #2: Administer 21 consecutive days of oral aripiprazole in conjunction with the first ARISTADA injection ( 2.1 ). ARISTADA can be initiated at a dose of 441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg administered monthly, 882 mg dose every 6 weeks, or 1064 mg dose every 2 months ( 2.1 ). Dosing regimen adjustments may be required for missed doses ( 2.2 ). Dose adjustments are required for 1) known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and 2) for patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP2D6 inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inducers for more than 2 weeks ( 2.4 ). 2.1 Recommended Dosage ARISTADA is only to be administered as an intramuscular injection by a healthcare professional. For patients who have never taken aripiprazole, establish tolerability with oral aripiprazole prior to initiating treatment with ARISTADA. Due to the half-life of oral aripiprazole, it may take up to 2 weeks to fully assess tolerability. Refer to the prescribing information of oral aripiprazole for the recommended dosage and administration of the oral formulation. There are two ways to initiate treatment with ARISTADA: Option #1: Administer one intramuscular injection of ARISTADA INITIO 675 mg (in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle) and one dose of oral aripiprazole 30 mg in conjunction with the first ARISTADA injection. The first ARISTADA injection may be administered on the same day as ARISTADA INITIO or up to 10 days thereafter. See the ARISTADA INITIO prescribing information for additional information regarding administration of ARISTADA INITIO. Avoid injecting both ARISTADA INITIO and ARISTADA concomitantly into the same deltoid or gluteal muscle. Option #2: Administer 21 consecutive days of oral aripiprazole in conjunction with the first ARISTADA injection. Depending on individual patient's needs, treatment with ARISTADA can be initiated at a dose of 441 mg, 662 mg or 882 mg administered monthly, 882 mg administered every 6 weeks or 1064 mg administered every 2 months. The 441 mg, 662 mg, 882 mg and 1064 mg doses correspond to 300 mg, 450 mg, 600 mg and 724 mg of aripiprazole, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].

Adjust the ARISTADA dose as needed. When making dose and dosing interval adjustments, consider the pharmacokinetics and prolonged-release characteristics of ARISTADA [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.2 Missed Doses When a dose of ARISTADA is missed, administer the next injection of ARISTADA as soon as possible. Depending on the time elapsed since the last ARISTADA injection, supplement the next ARISTADA injection as recommended in Table 3 below. Table 3: Recommendation for Concomitant Supplementation Following Missed Doses of ARISTADA Dose of Patient's Last ARISTADA Injection Length of Time Since Last Injection a The patient should supplement with the same dose of oral aripiprazole as when the patient began ARISTADA (see Table 2 ). 441 mg ≤ 6 weeks > 6 and ≤ 7 weeks > 7 weeks 662 mg ≤ 8 weeks > 8 and ≤ 12 weeks > 12 weeks 882 mg ≤ 8 weeks > 8 and ≤ 12 weeks > 12 weeks 1064 mg ≤ 10 weeks > 10 and ≤ 12 weeks > 12 weeks Dosage and Administration for Re-initiation of ARISTADA No Supplementation Required Supplement with a Single Dose of ARISTADA INITIO OR 7 Days of Oral Aripiprazole a Re-initiate with a Single Dose of ARISTADA INITIO and a Single Dose of Oral Aripiprazole 30 mg OR supplement with 21 Days of Oral Aripiprazole a 2.3 Early Dosing The recommended ARISTADA dosing interval is monthly for the 441 mg, 662 mg and 882 mg doses, every 6 weeks for the 882 mg dose, or every 2 months for the 1064 mg dose and should be maintained. In the event of early dosing, an ARISTADA injection should not be given earlier than 14 days after the previous injection.  2.5 Important Administration Instructions The kit contains a syringe containing ARISTADA sterile aqueous extended-release injectable suspension and 2 or 3 safety needles depending on dose (a 2-inch 20 gauge needle with yellow needle hub, a 1 ½-inch 20 gauge needle with yellow needle hub, and a 1-inch 21 gauge needle with green needle hub (441 mg kit only)) for intramuscular injection.

Avoid initiating ARISTADA treatment with ARISTADA INITIO in patients requiring dose adjustments. Once stabilized on ARISTADA, refer to the dosing recommendations below for patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or strong CYP3A4 inducers: No dosage changes recommended for ARISTADA, if CYP450 modulators are added for less than 2 weeks.

        "pharmacokinetics": "Atomoxetine is well-absorbed after oral administration and is minimally affected by food. It is eliminated primarily by oxidative metabolism through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymatic pathway and subsequent glucuronidation. Atomoxetine has a half-life of about 5 hours. A fraction of the population (about 7% of Caucasians and 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs. These individuals have reduced activity in this pathway resulting in 10-fold higher AUCs, 5-fold higher peak plasma concentrations, and slower elimination (plasma half-life of about 24 hours) of atomoxetine compared with people with normal activity [extensive metabolizers (EMs)]. Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and quinidine, cause similar increases in exposure. The pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine have been evaluated in more than 400 children and adolescents in selected clinical trials, primarily using population pharmacokinetic studies. Single-dose and steady-state individual pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in children, adolescents, and adults. When doses were normalized to a mg/kg basis, similar half-life, C max , and AUC values were observed in children, adolescents, and adults. Clearance and volume of distribution after adjustment for body weight were also similar. Absorption and distribution — Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of about 63% in EMs and 94% in PMs. Maximal plasma concentrations (C max ) are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing. STRATTERA can be administered with or without food. Administration of STRATTERA with a standard high-fat meal in adults did not affect the extent of oral absorption of atomoxetine (AUC), but did decrease the rate of absorption, resulting in a 37% lower C max , and delayed T max by 3 hours. In clinical trials with children and adolescents, administration of STRATTERA with food resulted in a 9% lower C max . The steady-state volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 0.85 L/kg indicating that atomoxetine distributes primarily into total body water. Volume of distribution is similar across the patient weight range after normalizing for body weight. At therapeutic concentrations, 98% of atomoxetine in plasma is bound to protein, primarily albumin. Metabolism and elimination — Atomoxetine is metabolized primarily through the CYP2D6 enzymatic pathway. People with reduced activity in this pathway (PMs) have higher plasma concentrations of atomoxetine compared with people with normal activity (EMs). For PMs, AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 10-fold and C ss,max is about 5-fold greater than EMs. Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs. Coadministration of STRATTERA with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or quinidine, results in a substantial increase in atomoxetine plasma exposure, and dosing adjustment may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . Atomoxetine did not inhibit or induce the CYP2D6 pathway. The major oxidative metabolite formed, regardless of CYP2D6 status, is 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, which is glucuronidated. 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter but circulates in plasma at much lower concentrations (1% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 0.1% of atomoxetine concentration in PMs). 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is primarily formed by CYP2D6, but in PMs, 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is formed at a slower rate by several other cytochrome P450 enzymes. N-Desmethylatomoxetine is formed by CYP2C19 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes, but has substantially less pharmacological activity compared with atomoxetine and circulates in plasma at lower concentrations (5% of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 45% of atomoxetine concentration in PMs). Mean apparent plasma clearance of atomoxetine after oral administration in adult EMs is 0.35 L/hr/kg and the mean half-life is 5.2 hours. Following oral administration of atomoxetine to PMs, mean apparent plasma clearance is 0.03 L/hr/kg and mean half-life is 21.6 hours. For PMs, AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 10-fold and C ss,max is about 5-fold greater than EMs. The elimination half-life of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine is similar to that of N-desmethylatomoxetine (6 to 8 hours) in EM subjects, while the half-life of N-desmethylatomoxetine is much longer in PM subjects (34 to 40 hours). Atomoxetine is excreted primarily as 4-hydroxyatomoxetine- O -glucuronide, mainly in the urine (greater than 80% of the dose) and to a lesser extent in the feces (less than 17% of the dose). Only a small fraction of the STRATTERA dose is excreted as unchanged atomoxetine (less than 3% of the dose), indicating extensive biotransformation.",
        "dosage": "Acute Treatment Dosing of children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight — STRATTERA should be initiated at a total daily dose of approximately 0.5 mg/kg and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg administered either as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon/early evening. No additional benefit has been demonstrated for doses higher than 1.2 mg/kg/day [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The total daily dose in children and adolescents should not exceed 1.4 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is less. Dosing of children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults — STRATTERA should be initiated at a total daily dose of 40 mg and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of approximately 80 mg administered either as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon/early evening. After 2 to 4 additional weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 100 mg in patients who have not achieved an optimal response. There are no data that support increased effectiveness at higher doses. The maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents over 70 kg and adults is 100 mg. 2.2 Maintenance/Extended Treatment It is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. The benefit of maintaining pediatric patients (ages 6-15 years) with ADHD on STRATTERA after achieving a response in a dose range of 1.2 to 1.8 mg/kg/day was demonstrated in a controlled trial. Patients assigned to STRATTERA in the maintenance phase were generally continued on the same dose used to achieve a response in the open label phase. The physician who elects to use STRATTERA for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 2.3 General Dosing Information STRATTERA may be taken with or without food. STRATTERA can be discontinued without being tapered. STRATTERA capsules are not intended to be opened, they should be taken whole [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17.6 )] . The safety of single doses over 120 mg and total daily doses above 150 mg have not been systematically evaluated. 2.4 Dosing in Specific Populations Dosing adjustment for hepatically impaired patients — For those ADHD patients who have hepatic insufficiency (HI), dosage adjustment is recommended as follows: For patients with moderate HI (Child-Pugh Class B), initial and target doses should be reduced to 50% of the normal dose (for patients without HI). For patients with severe HI (Child-Pugh Class C), initial dose and target doses should be reduced to 25% of normal [see Use In Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Dosing adjustment for use with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs — In children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine, or in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs, STRATTERA should be initiated at 0.5 mg/kg/day and only increased to the usual target dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day if symptoms fail to improve after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated. In children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine, STRATTERA should be initiated at 40 mg/day and only increased to the usual target dose of 80 mg/day if symptoms fail to improve after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated.",

Azathioprine tablets should be administered with caution to patients having one non-functional allele (heterozygous) who are at risk for reduced TPMT activity that may lead to toxicity if conventional doses are given. Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with reduced TPMT activity. Early drug discontinuation may be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. Renal Homotransplantation The dose of azathioprine tablets required to prevent rejection and minimize toxicity will vary with individual patients; this necessitates careful management. The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg/kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant. Azathioprine tablets are usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation. Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg/kg daily is usually possible. The dose of azathioprine tablets should not be increased to toxic levels because of threatened rejection. Discontinuation may be necessary for severe hematologic or other toxicity, even if rejection of the homograft may be a consequence of drug withdrawal. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine tablets are usually given on a daily basis. The initial dose should be approximately 1.0 mg/kg (50 to 100 mg) given as a single dose or on a twice-daily schedule. The dose may be increased, beginning at 6 to 8 weeks and thereafter by steps at 4-week intervals, if there are no serious toxicities and if initial response is unsatisfactory. Dose increments should be 0.5 mg/kg daily, up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg per day. Therapeutic response occurs after several weeks of treatment, usually 6 to 8; an adequate trial should be a minimum of 12 weeks. Patients not improved after 12 weeks can be considered refractory. Azathioprine tablets may be continued long-term in patients with clinical response, but patients should be monitored carefully, and gradual dosage reduction should be attempted to reduce risk of toxicities. Maintenance therapy should be at the lowest effective dose, and the dose given can be lowered decrementally with changes of 0.5 mg/kg or approximately 25 mg daily every 4 weeks while other therapy is kept constant. The optimum duration of maintenance azathioprine tablets has not been determined. Azathioprine tablets can be discontinued abruptly, but delayed effects are possible. Use in Renal Dysfunction Relatively oliguric patients, especially those with tubular necrosis in the immediate postcadaveric transplant period, may have delayed clearance of azathioprine tablets or its metabolites, may be particularly sensitive to this drug, and are usually given lower doses. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of this immunosuppressive antimetabolite drug should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 25-31 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "Consider alternative therapy in patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with heterozygous deficiency. Because of the risk of increased toxicity, dosage reduction is recommended in patients known to have heterozygous deficiency of TPMT or NUDT15. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 deficiency may require more substantial dosage reductions.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "The pharmacokinetic characteristics of belinostat were analyzed from pooled data from phase 1/2 clinical studies that used doses of belinostat ranging from 150 to 1200 mg/m 2 . The total mean plasma clearance and elimination half-life were 1240 mL/min and 1.1 hours, respectively. The total clearance approximates average hepatic blood flow (1500 mL/min), suggesting high hepatic extraction (clearance being flow dependent). Distribution The mean belinostat volume of distribution approaches total body water, indicating that belinostat has limited body tissue distribution. In vitro plasma studies have shown that between 92.9% and 95.8% of belinostat is bound to protein in an equilibrium dialysis assay, and was independent of belinostat plasma concentrations from 500 to 25,000 ng/mL. Elimination Metabolism Belinostat is primarily metabolized by hepatic UGT1A1. Strong UGT1A1 inhibitors are expected to increase exposure to belinostat. Belinostat also undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzymes to form belinostat amide and belinostat acid. The enzymes responsible for the formation of methyl belinostat and 3-(anilinosulfonyl)-benzenecarboxylic acid, (3-ASBA) are not known. Excretion Following a single dose of [ 14 C]-labelled belinostat (100 μCi, 1500 mg) administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion in patients with recurrent or progressive malignancy (N=6), fecal excretion accounted for a mean (± SD) of 9.7% (± 6.5%) of the administered radioactive belinostat dose over 168 hours. The mean (± SD) of the administered radioactive belinostat dose that was excreted in urine over 168 hours was 84.8% (± 9.8%), of which unchanged belinostat accounted for only 1.7%. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies showed belinostat and its metabolites (including belinostat glucuronide, belinostat amide, methyl belinostat) inhibited metabolic activities of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. Other metabolites (3-ASBA and belinostat acid) inhibited CYP2C8. In cancer patients, co-administration of Beleodaq (1,000 mg/m 2 ) and warfarin (5 mg), a known CYP2C9 substrate, did not increase the AUC or C max of either R- or S-warfarin. Belinostat is likely a glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is unlikely to inhibit P-gp.",
        "dosage": "Recommended dosage of Beleodaq is 1,000 mg/m2 administered over 30 minutes by intravenous infusion once daily on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle.

Cycles can be repeated every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.2 Dosage Modification for Hematologic and Non-Hematologic Toxicities Table 1 displays the recommended Beleodaq dosage modifications for hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Base dosage adjustments for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia on platelet and absolute neutrophil nadir (lowest value) counts in the preceding cycle of therapy. • Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be greater than or equal to 1.0 x 10 9 /L and the platelet count should be greater than or equal to 50 x 10 9 /L prior to the start of each cycle and prior to resuming treatment following toxicity. Resume subsequent treatment with Beleodaq according to the guidelines described in Table 1 below. Discontinue Beleodaq in patients who have recurrent ANC nadirs less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L and/or recurrent platelet count nadirs less than 25 x 10 9 /L after two dosage reductions. • Other toxicities must be NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 or less prior to re-treatment. Monitor complete blood counts at baseline and weekly. Perform serum chemistry tests, including renal and hepatic functions prior to the start of the first dose of each cycle.

Swirl the contents of the vial until there are no visible particles in the resulting solution. The reconstituted product may be stored for up to 12 hours at ambient temperature (15-25°C; 59-77°F). b) Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dosage (based on the 50 mg/mL concentration and the patient’s BSA [m2]) and transfer to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0.9 % Sodium Chloride injection. The infusion bag with drug solution may be stored at ambient room temperature (15-25°C; 59-77°F) for up to 36 hours including infusion time. c) Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter. Do not use if cloudiness or particulates are observed. d) Connect the infusion bag containing drug solution to an infusion set with a 0.22 µm in-line filter for administration. e) Infuse intravenously over 30 minutes. If infusion site pain or other symptoms potentially attributable to the infusion occur, the infusion time may be extended to 45 minutes.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption After single-dose administration of REXULTI tablets, the peak plasma brexpiprazole concentrations occurred within 4 hours after administration, and the absolute oral bioavailability was 95%. Brexpiprazole steady-state concentrations were attained within 10 to 12 days of dosing. REXULTI can be administered with or without food. Administration of a 4 mg REXULTI tablet with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C max or AUC of brexpiprazole. After single and multiple once daily dose administration, brexpiprazole exposure (C max and AUC) increased in proportion to the dose administered. In vitro studies of brexpiprazole did not indicate that brexpiprazole is a substrate of efflux transporters such as MDRI (P-gp) and BCRP. Distribution The volume of distribution of brexpiprazole following intravenous administration is high (1.56±0.42 L/kg), indicating extravascular distribution. Brexpiprazole is highly protein bound in plasma (greater than 99%) to serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, and its protein binding is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. Based on results of in vitro studies, brexpiprazole protein binding is not affected by warfarin, diazepam, or digitoxin. Elimination Metabolism Based on in vitro metabolism studies of brexpiprazole using recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4), the metabolism of brexpiprazole was shown to be mainly mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. In vivo brexpiprazole is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes. After single- and multiple-dose administrations, brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, were the predominant drug moieties in the systemic circulation. At steady-state, DM-3411 represented 23% to 48% of brexpiprazole exposure (AUC) in plasma. DM-3411 is considered not to contribute to the therapeutic effects of brexpiprazole. Based on in vitro data, brexpiprazole showed little to no inhibition of CYP450 isozymes. Excretion Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C]-labeled brexpiprazole, approximately 25% and 46% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. Less than 1% of unchanged brexpiprazole was excreted in the urine, and approximately 14% of the oral dose was recovered unchanged in the feces. Apparent oral clearance of a brexpiprazole oral tablet after once daily administration is 19.8 (±11.4) mL/h/kg. After multiple once daily administration of REXULTI, the terminal elimination half-lives of brexpiprazole and its major metabolite, DM-3411, were 91 hours and 86 hours, respectively. Studies in Specific Populations Exposures of brexpiprazole in specific populations are summarized in Figure 1. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis indicated exposure of brexpiprazole in patients with moderate renal impairment was higher compared to patients with normal renal function. Figure 1: Effects of Intrinsic Factors on Brexpiprazole Pharmacokinetics Figure 1 Drug Interaction Studies Effects of other drugs on the exposures of brexpiprazole are summarized in Figure 2. Based on simulation, a 5.1-fold increase in AUC values at steady-state is expected when extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 are administered with both strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors. A 4.8-fold increase in mean AUC values at steady-state is expected in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ].

        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption Following oral administration of 1,255 mg/m2 BID to cancer patients, capecitabine reached peak blood levels in about 1.5 hours (T max ) with peak 5-FU levels occurring slightly later, at 2 hours. Food reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine with mean C max and AUC 0-∞ decreased by 60% and 35%, respectively. The C max and AUC 0-∞ of 5-FU were also reduced by food by 43% and 21%, respectively. Food delayed T max of both parent and 5-FU by 1.5 hours [see Warnings and Precautions (5) , Dosage and Administration (2) , and Drug- Food Interaction (7.2) ]. The pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites have been evaluated in about 200 cancer patients over a dosage range of 500 to 3,500 mg/m 2 /day. Over this range, the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolite, 5’-DFCR were dose proportional and did not change over time. The increases in the AUCs of 5’-DFUR and 5- FU, however, were greater than proportional to the increase in dose and the AUC of 5-FU was 34% higher on day 14 than on day 1. The interpatient variability in the C max and AUC of 5-FU was greater than 85%. Distribution Plasma protein binding of capecitabine and its metabolites is less than 60% and is not concentration-dependent. Capecitabine was primarily bound to human albumin (approximately 35%). Capecitabine has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to plasma protein binding. Bioactivation and Metabolism Capecitabine is extensively metabolized enzymatically to 5-FU. In the liver, a 60 kDa carboxylesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5’-DFCR). Cytidine deaminase, an enzyme found in most tissues, including tumors, subsequently converts 5’-DFCR to 5’-DFUR. The enzyme, thymidine phosphorylase (dThdPase), then hydrolyzes 5’-DFUR to the active drug 5-FU. Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase. Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues. Following oral administration of capecitabine 7 days before surgery in patients with colorectal cancer, the median ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumors to adjacent tissues was 2.9 (range from 0.9 to 8). These ratios have not been evaluated in breast cancer patients or compared to 5-FU infusion. Metabolic Pathway of capecitabine to 5-FU The enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase hydrogenates 5-FU, the product of capecitabine metabolism, to the much less toxic 5-fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-fluorouracil (FUH2). Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5-fluoro-ureido-propionic acid (FUPA). Finally, β-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to α-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) which is cleared in the urine. In vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes indicated that capecitabine and its metabolites (5’ -DFUR, 5’-DFCR, 5-FU, and FBAL) did not inhibit the metabolism of test substrates by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2A6, 3A4, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1. Excretion Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in urine; 95.5% of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Fecal excretion is minimal (2.6%). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL which represents 57% of the administered dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life of both parent capecitabine and 5-FU was about 0.75 hour. Effect of Age, Gender, and Race on the Pharmacokinetics of Capecitabine A population analysis of pooled data from the two large controlled studies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (n=505) who were administered capecitabine at 1,250 mg/m 2 twice a day indicated that gender (202 females and 303 males) and race (455 white/Caucasian patients, 22 black patients, and 28 patients of other race) have no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 5’-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL. Age has no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of 5’-DFUR and 5-FU over the range of 27 to 86 years. A 20% increase in age results in a 15% increase in AUC of FBAL [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ]. Following oral administration of 825 mg/m 2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days, Japanese patients (n=18) had about 36% lower C max and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than the Caucasian patients (n=22). Japanese patients had also about 25% lower C max and 34% lower AUC for FBAL than the Caucasian patients. The clinical significance of these differences is unknown. No significant differences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5’-DFCR, 5’-DFUR, and 5-FU). Effect of Hepatic Insufficiency Capecitabine has been evaluated in 13 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases defined by a composite score including bilirubin, AST/ALT and alkaline phosphatase following a single 1,255 mg/m 2 dose of capecitabine. Both AUC 0-∞ and C max of capecitabine increased by 60% in patients with hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function (n=14). The AUC 0-∞ and C max of 5-FU were not affected. In patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases, caution should be exercised when capecitabine is administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on capecitabine is not known [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Effect of Renal Insufficiency Following oral administration of 1,250 mg/m 2 capecitabine twice a day to cancer patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, patients with moderate (creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) renal impairment showed 85% and 258% higher systemic exposure to FBAL on day 1 compared to normal renal function patients (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). Systemic exposure to 5’-DFUR was 42% and 71% greater in moderately and severely renal impaired patients, respectively, than in normal patients. Systemic exposure to capecitabine was about 25% greater in both moderately and severely renal impaired patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Effect of Capecitabine on the Pharmacokinetics of Warfarin In four patients with cancer, chronic administration of capecitabine (1,250 mg/m 2 bid) with a single 20 mg dose of warfarin increased the mean AUC of S-warfarin by 57% and decreased its clearance by 37%. Baseline corrected AUC of INR in these 4 patients increased by 2.8-fold, and the maximum observed mean INR value was increased by 91% [see Boxed Warning and Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Effect of Antacids on the Pharmacokinetics of Capecitabine When Maalox ® (20 mL), an aluminum hydroxide- and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid, was administered immediately after capecitabine (1,250 mg/m 2 , n=12 cancer patients), AUC and C max increased by 16% and 35%, respectively, for capecitabine and by 18% and 22%, respectively, for 5’-DFCR. No effect was observed on the other three major metabolites (5’-DFUR, 5-FU, FBAL) of capecitabine. Effect of Allopurinol on Capecitabine Published literature reported that concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease conversion of capecitabine to the active metabolites, FdUMP and FUTP; however, the clinical significance was not fully characterized. Effect of Capecitabine on the Pharmacokinetics of Docetaxel and Vice Versa A Phase 1 study evaluated the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel(Taxotere ® ) and the effect of docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine was conducted in 26 patients with solid tumors. capecitabine was found to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel (C max and AUC) and docetaxel has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and the 5-FU precursor 5’-DFUR.",

Table 1 displays the total daily dose of capecitabine tablets by body surface area and the number of tablets to be taken at each dose. 2.3 Dose Management Guidelines General Capecitabine tablets dosage may need to be individualized to optimize patient management. Patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity and doses of capecitabine tablets should be modified as necessary to accommodate individual patient tolerance to treatment [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Toxicity due to capecitabine tablets administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment, dose interruptions and adjustment of capecitabine tablets dose. Once the dose has been reduced, it should not be increased at a later time. Doses of capecitabine tablets omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment cycles. The dose of phenytoin and the dose of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants may need to be reduced when either drug is administered concomitantly with capecitabine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Monotherapy (Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Adjuvant Colorectal Cancer, Metastatic Breast Cancer) Capecitabine tablets dose modification scheme as described below (see Table 2 ) is recommended for the management of adverse reactions.

At the beginning of a treatment cycle, if a treatment delay is indicated for either capecitabine tablets or docetaxel, then administration of both agents should be delayed until the requirements for restarting both drugs are met. The dose reduction schedule for docetaxel when used in combination with capecitabine tablets for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer is shown in Table 3 .

In patients with moderate renal impairment (baseline creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL/min), a dose reduction to 75% of the capecitabine tablets starting dose when used as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel (from 1,250 mg/m 2 to 950 mg/m 2 twice daily) is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Subsequent dose adjustment is recommended as outlined in Table 2 and Table 3 (depending on the regimen) if a patient develops a grade 2 to 4 adverse event [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. The starting dose adjustment recommendations for patients with moderate renal impairment apply to both capecitabine tablets monotherapy and capecitabine tablets in combination use with docetaxel. Cockroft and Gault Equation: (140 - age [yrs]) (body wt [kg]) Creatinine clearance for males = ————————————— (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 x male value Geriatrics Physicians should exercise caution in monitoring the effects of capecitabine tablets in the elderly. Insufficient data are available to provide a dosage recommendation.",

(7.1) Allopurinol: Avoid the use of allopurinol during treatment with capecitabine. Food reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine. ( 2 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Anticoagulants Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon [see Boxed Warning ]. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping capecitabine. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. In a drug interaction study with single-dose warfarin administration, there was a significant increase in the mean AUC of S-warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The maximum observed INR value increased by 91%. This interaction is probably due to an inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 by capecitabine and/or its metabolites. Phenytoin The level of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking capecitabine and phenytoin dose may need to be reduced [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. Postmarketing reports indicate that some patients receiving capecitabine and phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated phenytoin levels. Formal drug-drug interaction studies with phenytoin have not been conducted, but the mechanism of interaction is presumed to be inhibition of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme by capecitabine and/or its metabolites. Leucovorin The concentration of 5-fluorouracil is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by leucovorin. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly leucovorin and fluorouracil. CYP2C9 substrates Other than warfarin, no formal drug-drug interaction studies between capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted. Care should be exercised when capecitabine is coadministered with CYP2C9 substrates. Allopurinol Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine’s active metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ], which may decrease capecitabine efficacy. Avoid the use of allopurinol during treatment with capecitabine. 7.2 Drug-Food Interaction Food was shown to reduce both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. It is recommended that capecitabine be administered with food.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "Celecoxib exhibits dose-proportional increase in exposure after oral administration up to 200 mg twice daily and less than proportional increase at higher doses. It has extensive distribution and high protein binding. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 with a half-life of approximately 11 hours. Absorption Peak plasma levels of celecoxib occur approximately 3 hours after an oral dose. Under fasting conditions, both peak plasma levels (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are roughly dose-proportional up to 200 mg twice daily; at higher doses there are less than proportional increases in C max and AUC (see Food Effects) . Absolute bioavailability studies have not been conducted. With multiple dosing, steady-state conditions are reached on or before Day 5. The pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib in a group of healthy subjects are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Summary of Single Dose (200 mg) Disposition Kinetics of Celecoxib in Healthy Subjects 1 Mean (%CV) PK Parameter Values C max , ng/mL T max , hr Effective t 1/2 , hr V ss /F, L CL/F, L/hr 705 (38) 2.8 (37) 11.2 (31) 429 (34) 27.7 (28) 1 Subjects under fasting conditions (n=36, 19 to 52 yrs.) Food Effects When celecoxib capsules were taken with a high fat meal, peak plasma levels were delayed for about 1 to 2 hours with an increase in total absorption (AUC) of 10% to 20%. Under fasting conditions, at doses above 200 mg, there is less than a proportional increase in C max and AUC, which is thought to be due to the low solubility of the drug in aqueous media. Coadministration of celecoxib with an aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids resulted in a reduction in plasma celecoxib concentrations with a decrease of 37% in C max and 10% in AUC. Celecoxib, at doses up to 200 mg twice daily, can be administered without regard to timing of meals. Higher doses (400 mg twice daily) should be administered with food to improve absorption. In healthy adult volunteers, the overall systemic exposure (AUC) of celecoxib was equivalent when celecoxib was administered as intact capsule or capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce. There were no significant alterations in C max , T max or t 1/2 after administration of capsule contents on applesauce [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Distribution In healthy subjects, celecoxib is highly protein bound (~97%) within the clinical dose range. In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib binds primarily to albumin and, to a lesser extent, α1-acid glycoprotein. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V ss /F) is approximately 400 L, suggesting extensive distribution into the tissues. Celecoxib is not preferentially bound to red blood cells. Elimination Metabolism Celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via CYP2C9. Three metabolites, a primary alcohol, the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate, have been identified in human plasma. These metabolites are inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Excretion Celecoxib is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism with little (<3%) unchanged drug recovered in the urine and feces. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 57% of the dose was excreted in the feces and 27% was excreted into the urine. The primary metabolite in both urine and feces was the carboxylic acid metabolite (73% of dose) with low amounts of the glucuronide also appearing in the urine. It appears that the low solubility of the drug prolongs the absorption process making terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) determinations more variable. The effective half-life is approximately 11 hours under fasted conditions. The apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) is about 500 mL/min. Specific Populations Geriatric At steady state, elderly subjects (over 65 years old) had a 40% higher C max and a 50% higher AUC compared to the young subjects. In elderly females, celecoxib C max and AUC are higher than those for elderly males, but these increases are predominantly due to lower body weight in elderly females. Dose adjustment in the elderly is not generally necessary. However, for patients of less than 50 kg in body weight, initiate therapy at the lowest recommended dose [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Pediatric The steady state pharmacokinetics of celecoxib administered as an investigational oral suspension was evaluated in 152 JRA patients 2 years to 17 years of age weighing ≥10 kg with pauciarticular or polyarticular course JRA and in patients with systemic onset JRA. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the oral clearance (unadjusted for body weight) of celecoxib increases less than proportionally to increasing weight, with 10 kg and 25 kg patients predicted to have 40% and 24% lower clearance, respectively, compared with a 70 kg adult RA patient. Twice-daily administration of 50 mg capsules to JRA patients weighing ≥12 to ≤25 kg and 100 mg capsules to JRA patients weighing >25 kg should achieve plasma concentrations similar to those observed in a clinical trial that demonstrated the non-inferiority of celecoxib to naproxen 7.5 mg/kg twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Celecoxib has not been studied in JRA patients under the age of 2 years, in patients with body weight less than 10 kg (22 lbs), or beyond 24 weeks. Race Meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies has suggested an approximately 40% higher AUC of celecoxib in Blacks compared to Caucasians. The cause and clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Hepatic Impairment A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment has shown that steady-state celecoxib AUC is increased about 40% and 180%, respectively, above that seen in healthy control subjects. Therefore, the daily recommended dose of celecoxib capsules should be reduced by approximately 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied. The use of celecoxib in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Renal Impairment In a cross-study comparison, celecoxib AUC was approximately 40% lower in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (GFR 35 to 60 mL/min) than that seen in subjects with normal renal function. No significant relationship was found between GFR and celecoxib clearance. Patients with severe renal insufficiency have not been studied. Similar to other NSAIDs, celecoxib is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9, 2C19 or 3A4. In vivo studies have shown the following: Aspirin When NSAIDs were administered with aspirin, the protein binding of NSAIDs were reduced, although the clearance of free NSAID was not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions of NSAIDs with aspirin [ see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Lithium In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean steady-state lithium plasma levels increased approximately 17% in subjects receiving lithium 450 mg twice daily with celecoxib capsule 200 mg twice daily as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Fluconazole Concomitant administration of fluconazole at 200 mg once daily resulted in a two-fold increase in celecoxib plasma concentration. This increase is due to the inhibition of celecoxib metabolism via P450 2C9 by fluconazole [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Other Drugs The effects of celecoxib on the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of glyburide, ketoconazole, [ see Drug Interactions (7) ], phenytoin, and tolbutamide have been studied in vivo and clinically important interactions have not been found.",

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [ see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. These doses can be given without regard to timing of meals. 2.2 Osteoarthritis For OA, the dosage is 200 mg per day administered as a single dose or as 100 mg twice daily. 2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis For RA, the dosage is 100 mg to 200 mg twice daily. 2.4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis For JRA, the dosage for pediatric patients (age 2 years and older) is based on weight. For patients > 10 kg to < 25 kg the recommended dose is 50 mg twice daily. For patients >25 kg the recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily. For patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules, the contents of a celecoxib capsule can be added to applesauce. The entire capsule contents are carefully emptied onto a level teaspoon of cool or room temperature applesauce and ingested immediately with water. The sprinkled capsule contents on applesauce are stable for up to 6 hours under refrigerated conditions (2°C to 8°C/ 35°F to 45°F). 2.5 Ankylosing Spondylitis For AS, the dosage of celecoxib capsule is 200 mg daily in single (once per day) or divided (twice per day) doses. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg daily may be worthwhile. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks on 400 mg daily, a response is not likely and consideration should be given to alternate treatment options. 2.6 Management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea For management of Acute Pain and Treatment of Primary Dysmenorrhea, the dosage is 400 mg initially, followed by an additional 200 mg dose if needed on the first day.

In patients with JRA who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers, consider using alternative treatments.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "CYP2C9 Inhibitors or inducers Clinical Impact: Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Co­administration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 (e.g., fluconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of celecoxib whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of celecoxib. Intervention Evaluate each patient's medical history when consideration is given to prescribing celecoxib. A dosage adjustment may be warranted when celecoxib is administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. CYP2D6 substrates Clinical Impact: In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., atomoxetine), and celecoxib may enhance the exposure and toxicity of these drugs.

        "pharmacokinetics": "Pharmacokinetics The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10-60 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and oral solution dosage forms of citalopram HBr are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%. Metabolism and Elimination Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance. Citalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram. Population Subgroups Age Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects ≥ 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the elderly subjects by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most elderly patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Gender In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is recommended. Reduced hepatic function Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 20 mg is the recommended dose for most hepatically impaired patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Reduced renal function In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min). Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited. Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram HBr, suggesting that coadministration, with citalopram HBr, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism.",
        "dosage": "Initial Treatment Citalopram HBr should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended. Citalopram HBr should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. Special Populations 20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for nonresponding patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Citalopram HBr should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester Neonates exposed to citalopram HBr and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS ). When treating pregnant women with citalopram HBr during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering citalopram HBr in the third trimester. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of citalopram HBr in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of citalopram HBr (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of citalopram HBr 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered. Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr Symptoms associated with discontinuation of citalopram HBr and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of citalopram HBr therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram HBr before starting an MAOI.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "Warfarin Administration of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Carbamazepine Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. Triazolam Combined administration of citalopram HBr (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam. Ketoconazole Combined administration of citalopram HBr (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Metoprolol Administration of 40 mg/day citalopram HBr for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram HBr and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate. Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) In vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram HBr (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with citalopram HBr.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "The peak plasma levels (Cmax) and the area under the curve (AUC) of clobazam are dose-proportional over the dose range of 10-80 mg following single- or multiple-dose administration of clobazam oral suspension. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of clobazam are linear from 5-160 mg/day. Clobazam is converted to N-desmethylclobazam which has about 1/5 the activity of clobazam. The estimated mean elimination half-lives (t½) of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam were 36-42 hours and 71-82 hours, respectively. Absorption Clobazam is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration. The time to peak concentrations (T max ) of clobazam tablets under fasted conditions ranged from 0.5 to 4 hours after single- or multiple-dose administrations. The relative bioavailability of clobazam tablets compared to an oral solution is approximately 100%. After single dose administration of the oral suspension under fasted conditions, the T max ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours. Based on exposure (C max and AUC) of clobazam, clobazam tablets and suspension were shown to have similar bioavailability under fasted conditions. The administration of clobazam tablets with food or when crushed in applesauce does not affect absorption. Although not studied, the oral bioavailability of the oral suspension is unlikely to be affected under fed conditions. Distribution Clobazam is lipophilic and distributes rapidly throughout the body. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state was approximately 100 L. The in vitro plasma protein binding of clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam is approximately 80-90% and 70%, respectively. Metabolism and Excretion Clobazam is extensively metabolized in the liver, with approximately 2% of the dose recovered in urine and 1% in feces as unchanged drug. The major metabolic pathway of clobazam involves N-demethylation, primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. N-desmethylclobazam, an active metabolite, is the major circulating metabolite in humans, and at therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations are 3-5 times higher than those of the parent compound. Based on animal and in vitro receptor binding data, estimates of the relative potency of N-desmethylclobazam compared to parent compound range from 1/5 to equal potency. N-desmethylclobazam is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP2C19. N-desmethylclobazam and its metabolites comprise ~94% of the total drug-related components in urine. Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled drug, approximately 11% of the dose was excreted in the feces and approximately 82% was excreted in the urine. The polymorphic CYP2C19 is the major contributor to the metabolism of the pharmacologically active N-desmethylclobazam [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam were 5-fold higher in plasma and 2- to 3-fold higher in the urine than in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the clearance of clobazam is lower in elderly subjects compared to other age groups (ages 2 to 64). Dosing should be adjusted in the elderly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Sex Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed no difference in the clearance of clobazam between women and men. Race Population pharmacokinetic analyses including Caucasian (75%), African American (15%), and Asian (9%) subjects showed that there is no evidence of clinically significant effect of race on the clearance of clobazam. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam was evaluated in patients with mild (creatinine clearance [CLCR] >50 to 80 mL/min; N=6) and moderate (CLCR=30 to 50 mL/min; N=6) renal dysfunction, with matching healthy controls (N=6), following administration of multiple doses of clobazam oral suspension 20 mg/day. There were insignificant changes in Cmax (3-24%) and AUC (≤13%) for clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD were not included in this study. Hepatic Impairment There are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam. In a small study, the pharmacokinetics of a 20 mg single oral dose of clobazam oral suspension in 9 patients with liver impairment were compared to healthy controls (N=6). The Cmax and the mean plasma clearance of clobazam, as well as the Cmax of N-desmethylclobazam, showed no significant change compared to the healthy controls. The AUC values of N-desmethylclobazam in these patients were not available. Adjust dosage in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies: Clobazam did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, or UGT2B4 in vitro. N-desmethylclobazam showed weak inhibition of CYP2C9, UGT1A4, UGT1A6 and UGT2B4. Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam did not significantly increase CYP1A2 or CYP2C19 activities, but did induce CYP3A4 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam also increased UGT1A1 mRNA but at concentrations much higher than therapeutic levels. The potential for clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam to induce CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 has not been evaluated. Clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam do not inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but are P-gp substrates. In vivo studies: Potential for clobazam oral suspension to Affect Other Drugs The effect of repeated 40 mg once-daily doses of clobazam oral suspension on the pharmacokinetic profiles of single-dose dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), and tolbutamide (CYP2C9 substrate), was studied when these probe substrates were given as a drug cocktail (N=18). Clobazam increased AUC and Cmax of dextromethorphan by 90% and 59%, respectively, reflecting its inhibition of CYP2D6 in vivo. Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may require dose adjustment when used with clobazam oral suspension. Clobazam decreased the AUC and Cmax of midazolam by 27% and 24%, respectively, and increased the AUC and Cmax of the metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam by 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively. This level of induction does not call for dosage adjustment of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 when used concomitantly with clobazam oral suspension. Some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4 and their effectiveness may be diminished when given with clobazam oral suspension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Repeated clobazam oral suspension doses had no effect on caffeine and tolbutamide. A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated clobazam did not affect the exposure of valproic acid (a CYP2C9/2C19 substrate) or lamotrigine (a UGT substrate). Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Clobazam oral suspension Co-administration of ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) 400 mg once-daily for 5 days increased clobazam AUC by 54%, with an insignificant effect on clobazam Cmax. There was no significant change in AUC and Cmax of N-desmethylclobazam (N=18). Strong (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) and moderate (e.g., omeprazole) inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in up to a 5-fold increase in exposure to N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam, based on extrapolation from pharmacogenomic data [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. Dosage adjustment of clobazam oral suspension may be necessary when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. The effects of concomitant antiepileptic drugs that are CYP3A4 inducers (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), CYP2C19 inducers (valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), and CYP2C19 inhibitors (felbamate and oxcarbazepine) were evaluated using data from clinical trials. Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis show that these concomitant antiepileptic drugs did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of clobazam or N-desmethylclobazam at steady-state. Alcohol has been reported to increase the maximum plasma exposure of clobazam by approximately 50%. Alcohol may have additive CNS depressant effects when taken with clobazam oral suspension.",
        "dosage": "For doses above 5 mg/day administer in two divided doses ( 2.1 ) Patients ≤30 kg body weight: Initiate at 5 mg daily and titrate as tolerated up to 20 mg daily ( 2.1 ) Patients >30 kg body weight: Initiate at 10 mg daily and titrate as tolerated up to 40 mg daily ( 2.1 ) Dosage adjustment needed in following groups: o Geriatric patients ( 2.4 , 8.5 ) o Known CYP2C19 poor metabolizers ( 2.5 ) o Mild or moderate hepatic impairment; no information for severe hepatic impairment ( 2.7 , 8.8 ) Measure prescribed amount of oral suspension using provided adapter and dosing syringe ( 2.3 ) Oral suspension: Can be taken with or without food ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Dosing Information A daily dose of clobazam oral suspension greater than 5 mg should be administered in divided doses twice daily; a 5 mg daily dose can be administered as a single dose. Dose patients according to body weight. Individualize dosing within each body weight group, based on clinical efficacy and tolerability. Each dose in Table 1 (e.g., 5 to 20 mg in ≤30 kg weight group) has been shown to be effective, although effectiveness increases with increasing dose [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Do not proceed with dose escalation more rapidly than weekly, because serum concentrations of clobazam and its active metabolite require 5 and 9 days, respectively, to reach steady-state. Table 1. Recommended Total Daily Dosing by Weight Group ≤30 kg Body Weight >30 kg Body Weight Starting Dose 5 mg 10 mg Starting Day 7 10 mg 20 mg Starting Day 14 20 mg 40 mg 2.2 Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of clobazam oral suspension To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue clobazam oral suspension or reduce the dosage. Taper by decreasing the total daily dose by 5-10 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] . 2.3 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to read the “Instructions for Use” carefully for complete directions on how to properly dose and administer clobazam oral suspension. Clobazam oral suspension Oral Administration Clobazam oral suspension can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Shake clobazam oral suspension well before every administration. When administering the oral suspension, use only the oral dosing syringe provided with the product. Each carton includes two syringes, but only one syringe should be used for dosing. The second oral syringe is reserved as a replacement in case the first syringe is damaged or lost. Insert the provided adapter firmly into the neck of the bottle before first use and keep the adapter in place for the duration of the usage of the bottle. To withdraw the dose, insert the dosing syringe into the adapter and invert the bottle then slowly pull back t he plunger to prescribed dose. After removing the syringe from the bottle adapter, slowly squirt clobazam oral suspension into the corner of the patient’s mouth. Replace the cap after each use. The cap fits over the adapter when the adapter is properly placed. See clobazam oral suspension “Instructions for Use” for complete instruction on how to properly dose and administer the clobazam oral suspension. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments in Geriatric Patients Plasma concentrations at any given dose are generally higher in the elderly: proceed slowly with dose escalation. The starting dose should be 5 mg/day for all elderly patients. Then titrate elderly patients according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, an additional titration to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on weight) may be started on day 21 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments in CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, levels of N-desmethylclobazam, clobazam’s active metabolite, will be increased. Therefore, in patients known to be CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the starting dose should be 5 mg/day and dose titration should proceed slowly according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, an additional titration to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on the weight group) may be started on day 21 [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.5 )]. 2.6 Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is no experience with clobazam oral suspension in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is not known if clobazam or its active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, is dialyzable [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.7 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Clobazam oral suspension is hepatically metabolized; however, there are limited data to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clobazam oral suspension. For this reason, proceed slowly with dosing escalations. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-9), the starting dose should be 5 mg/day in both weight groups. Then titrate patients according to weight, but to half the dose presented in Table 1, as tolerated. If necessary and based upon clinical response, start an additional titration on day 21 to the maximum dose (20 mg/day or 40 mg/day, depending on the weight group). There is inadequate information about metabolism of clobazam oral suspension in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore no dosing recommendation in those patients can be given.",

Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 7.2 CNS Depressants and Alcohol Concomitant use of clobazam oral suspension with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 4)]. Alcohol, as a CNS depressant, will interact with clobazam oral suspension in a similar way and also increases clobazam’s maximum plasma exposure by approximately 50%. Therefore, caution patients or their caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and caution that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5. 4)]. 7.3 Effect of Clobazam oral suspension on Other Drugs Hormonal Contraceptives Clobazam oral suspension is a weak CYP3A4 inducer. As some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4, their effectiveness may be diminished when given with clobazam oral suspension. Additional non- hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using clobazam oral suspension [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clobazam oral suspension inhibits CYP2D6. Dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may be necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.4 Effect of Other Drugs on Clobazam oral suspension Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in increased exposure to N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam. This may increase the risk of dose-related adverse reactions. Dosage adjustment of clobazam oral suspension may be necessary when co-administered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].",

        "pharmacokinetics": "Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites. Absorption After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites. Effect of Food Plavix can be administered with or without food. In a study in healthy male subjects when Plavix 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast, mean inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9%. The active metabolite AUC 0–24 was unchanged in the presence of food, while there was a 57% decrease in active metabolite Cmax. Similar results were observed when a Plavix 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high-fat breakfast. Metabolism Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Subsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. This metabolic pathway is mediated by CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet. The Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose. Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing. In the 75 to 300 mg dose range, the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality: increasing the dose by a factor of four results in 2.0- and 2.7-fold increases in Cmax and AUC, respectively. Elimination Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46% in feces over the 5 days post-dosing. After a single, oral dose of 75 mg, clopidogrel has a half-life of approximately 6 hours. The half-life of the active metabolite is about 30 minutes.",

Initiate aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and continue in combination with Plavix [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] .

( 7.3 ) 7.1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition. Avoid concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, e.g., omeprazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . Omeprazole In a crossover clinical study, 72 healthy subjects were administered Plavix (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day) alone and with omeprazole (80 mg at the same time as Plavix) for 5 days. The exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel was decreased by 46% (Day 1) and 42% (Day 5) when Plavix and omeprazole were administered together. Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation was diminished by 47% (24 hours) and 30% (Day 5) when Plavix and omeprazole were administered together. In another study, 72 healthy subjects were given the same doses of Plavix and omeprazole but the drugs were administered 12 hours apart; the results were similar, indicating that administering Plavix and omeprazole at different times does not prevent their interaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 7.2 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 7.3 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates) Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis.

        "pharmacokinetics": "After oral dosing up to 25 mg, plasma concentrations of deutetrabenazine are generally below the limit of detection because of the extensive hepatic metabolism of deutetrabenazine to the active deuterated dihydro metabolites (HTBZ), α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. Linear dose dependence of C max and AUC was observed for the active metabolites following single or multiple doses of deutetrabenazine (6 mg to 24 mg and 7.5 mg twice daily to 22.5 mg twice daily). Absorption Following oral administration of deutetrabenazine, the extent of absorption is at least 80%. Plasma concentrations of deutetrabenazine are generally below the limit of detection after oral dosing. Peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of deuterated α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are reached within 3 to 4 hours after dosing. Effect of Food The effects of food on the bioavailability of AUSTEDO were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. Food had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ, although C max was increased by approximately 50% in the presence of food [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Distribution The median volume of distribution (Vc/F) of the α-HTBZ, and the β-HTBZ metabolites of AUSTEDO are approximately 500 L and 730 L, respectively. Results of PET-scan studies in humans show that following intravenous injection of 11 C-labeled tetrabenazine or α-HTBZ, radioactivity is rapidly distributed to the brain, with the highest binding in the striatum and lowest binding in the cortex. The in vitro protein binding of tetrabenazine, α-HTBZ, and β-HTBZ was examined in human plasma for concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 ng/mL. Tetrabenazine binding ranged from 82% to 85%, α-HTBZ binding ranged from 60% to 68%, and β-HTBZ binding ranged from 59% to 63%. Elimination AUSTEDO is primarily renally eliminated in the form of metabolites. The half-life of total (α+β)-HTBZ from deutetrabenazine is approximately 9 to 10 hours. The median clearance values (CL/F) of the α-HTBZ, and the β-HTBZ metabolites of AUSTEDO are approximately 47 L/hour and 70 L/hour, respectively, in the Huntington’s disease patient population. Metabolism In vitro experiments in human liver microsomes demonstrate that deutetrabenazine is extensively biotransformed, mainly by carbonyl reductase, to its major active metabolites, α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ, which are subsequently metabolized primarily by CYP2D6, with minor contributions of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5, to form several minor metabolites. Excretion In a mass balance study in 6 healthy subjects, 75% to 86% of the deutetrabenazine dose was excreted in the urine, and fecal recovery accounted for 8% to 11% of the dose. Urinary excretion of the α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ metabolites from deutetrabenazine each accounted for less than 10% of the administered dose. Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of the α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ metabolites of deutetrabenazine, as well as products of oxidative metabolism, accounted for the majority of metabolites in the urine. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients There is no apparent effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of α-HTBZ and β‑HTBZ of deutetrabenazine. Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted to assess the effect of renal impairment on the PK of AUSTEDO. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deutetrabenazine and its primary metabolites has not been studied. However, in a clinical study conducted to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor, the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was up to 40% greater in patients with hepatic impairment, and the mean tetrabenazine C max in patients with hepatic impairment was up to 190-fold higher than in healthy subjects [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Although the pharmacokinetics of deutetrabenazine and its metabolites have not been systematically evaluated in patients who do not express the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6, it is likely that the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ would be increased similarly to taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (approximately 3-fold) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Drug Interaction Studies Deutetrabenazine, α-HTBZ, and β-HTBZ have not been evaluated in in vitro studies for induction or inhibition of CYP enzymes or interaction with P-glycoprotein. The results of in vitro studies of tetrabenazine do not suggest that tetrabenazine or its α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ metabolites are likely to result in clinically significant inhibition of CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A. In vitro studies suggest that neither tetrabenazine nor its α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ metabolites are likely to result in clinically significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19. Neither tetrabenazine nor its α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ metabolites are likely to be a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein at clinically relevant concentrations in vivo . The deutetrabenazine metabolites, 2-methylpropanoic acid of β-HTBZ (M1) and monohydroxy tetrabenazine (M4), have been evaluated in a panel of in vitro drug-drug interaction studies; the results indicate that M1/M4 are not expected to cause clinically relevant drug interactions. CYP2D6 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicate that the α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ metabolites of deutetrabenazine are substrates for CYP2D6. The effect of CYP2D6 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of deutetrabenazine and its metabolites was studied in 24 healthy subjects following a single 22.5 mg dose of deutetrabenazine given after 8 days of administration of the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine 20 mg daily. In the presence of paroxetine, systemic exposure (AUC inf ) of α-HTBZ was 1.9-fold higher and β-HTBZ was 6.5-fold higher, resulting in approximately 3-fold increase in AUC inf for total (α+β)-HTBZ. Paroxetine decreased the clearance of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ metabolites of AUSTEDO with corresponding increases in mean half-life of approximately 1.5-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively. In the presence of paroxetine, C max of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ were 1.2-fold and 2.2-fold higher, respectively. The effect of moderate or weak CYP2D6 inhibitors such as duloxetine, terbinafine, amiodarone, or sertraline on the exposure of deutetrabenazine and its metabolites has not been evaluated. Digoxin AUSTEDO was not evaluated for interaction with digoxin. Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. A study in healthy subjects showed that tetrabenazine (25 mg twice daily for 3 days) did not affect the bioavailability of digoxin, suggesting that at this dose, tetrabenazine does not affect P‑glycoprotein in the intestinal tract. In vitro studies also do not suggest that tetrabenazine or its metabolites are P-glycoprotein inhibitors.",

See full prescribing information for recommended conversion table ( 2.2 ) Maximum recommended dosage of AUSTEDO in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers is 36 mg per day (i.e., 18 mg twice daily) ( 2.4 , 8.7 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The dose of AUSTEDO is determined individually for each patient based on reduction of chorea or tardive dyskinesia and tolerability. When first prescribed to patients who are not being switched from tetrabenazine (a related VMAT2 inhibitor), the recommended starting dose of AUSTEDO is 6 mg administered orally once daily for patients with Huntington’s disease and 12 mg per day (6 mg twice daily) for patients with tardive dyskinesia. The dose of AUSTEDO may be increased at weekly intervals in increments of 6 mg per day to a maximum recommended daily dosage of 48 mg. Administer total daily dosages of 12 mg or above in two divided doses. Administer AUSTEDO with food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Swallow AUSTEDO whole. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets. 2.2 Switching Patients from Tetrabenazine (XENAZINE ® ) to AUSTEDO Discontinue tetrabenazine (XENAZINE ® ) and initiate AUSTEDO the following day. The recommended initial dosing regimen of AUSTEDO in patients switching from tetrabenazine (XENAZINE ® ) to AUSTEDO is shown in Table 1.

Concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion) has been shown to increase the systemic exposure to the active dihydro-metabolites of deutetrabenazine by approximately 3-fold. The daily dose of AUSTEDO should not exceed 36 mg per day, and the maximum single dose of AUSTEDO should not exceed 18 mg in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Reserpine Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2 and the duration of its effect is several days. Prescribers should wait for chorea or dyskinesia to reemerge before administering AUSTEDO to help reduce the risk of overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting AUSTEDO. AUSTEDO and reserpine should not be used concomitantly [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) AUSTEDO is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs. AUSTEDO should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.4 Neuroleptic Drugs The risk of parkinsonism, NMS, and akathisia may be increased by concomitant use of AUSTEDO and dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics. 7.5 Alcohol or Other Sedating Drugs Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 7.6 Concomitant Tetrabenazine or Valbenazine AUSTEDO is contraindicated in patients currently taking tetrabenazine or valbenazine.

        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption The oral bioavailability of eliglustat was less than 5% in CYP2D6 EMs following a single 84 mg dose of CERDELGA. In CYP2D6 EMs, the eliglustat pharmacokinetics is time-dependent and the systemic exposure increases in a more than dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 42 to 294 mg (0.5 to 3.5 times the recommended dosage). In addition, after multiple oral doses of 84 mg twice daily in EMs, eliglustat systemic exposure (AUC 0–12 ) increased up to about 2-fold at steady state compared to after the first dose (AUC 0–∞ ). The pharmacokinetics of eliglustat in CYP2D6 PMs is expected to be linear and time-independent. Compared to EMs, the systemic exposure following 84 mg twice daily at steady state is 7-fold to 9-fold higher in PMs. Dosing of CERDELGA 84 mg once daily has not been studied in PMs. The predicted C max and AUC 0–24hr in PMs using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with 84 mg once daily were 75 ng/mL and 956 hr∙ng/mL, respectively. Table 7 describes the pharmacokinetic parameters for eliglustat in healthy subjects following multiple doses of 84 mg CERDELGA twice daily.

Distribution Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of eliglustat was 835 L in EMs. Plasma protein binding of eliglustat ranges from 76% to 83%. Elimination Eliglustat terminal elimination half-life was approximately 6.5 hours in CYP2D6 EMs, and 8.9 hours in PMs. Following intravenous administration of 42 mg (0.5 times the recommended oral dose) in healthy subjects, the mean (range) of eliglustat total body clearance was 88 L/h (80 to 105 L/h) in EMs. Metabolism CERDELGA is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. Excretion After oral administration of radiolabeled eliglustat, the majority of the administered dose is excreted in urine (42%) and feces (51%), mainly as metabolites. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of eliglustat were observed based on age (18 to 71 years), sex, race (mostly were Caucasian, including those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent; however, it included the following populations: African American, American Indians, Hispanics, and Asians), or body weight (41 to 136 kg). Patients with renal impairment Eliglustat pharmacokinetics was similar in CYP2D6 EMs with severe renal impairment and healthy CYP2D6 EMs. Eliglustat pharmacokinetics in EMs with ESRD and in IMs or PMs with any degree of renal impairment is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with hepatic impairment Table 8 describes the effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of eliglustat in CYP2D6 EMs compared to EMs with normal hepatic function following a single 84 mg dose. The effect of hepatic impairment is highly variable with the coefficients of variation (CVs%) of 135% and 110% for C max and 171% and 121% for AUC in CYP2D6 EMs with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively.

        "pharmacokinetics": "The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Biotransformation of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 27 to 32 hours. With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2 to 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram are bioequivalent. Absorption and Distribution Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and the volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable. The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%. Metabolism and Elimination Following oral administrations of escitalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as escitalopram and S-demethylcitalopram (S-DCT) is about 8% and 10%, respectively. The oral clearance of escitalopram is 600 mL/min, with approximately 7% of that due to renal clearance. Escitalopram is metabolized to S-DCT and S-didemethylcitalopram (S-DDCT). In humans, unchanged escitalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentration of the escitalopram metabolite S-DCT in plasma is approximately one-third that of escitalopram. The level of S-DDCT was not detectable in most subjects. In vitro studies show that escitalopram is at least 7 and 27 times more potent than S-DCT and S-DDCT, respectively, in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites of escitalopram do not contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of escitalopram. S-DCT and S-DDCT also have no or very low affinity for serotonergic (5-HT 1 to 7 ) or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine (D 1 to 5 ), histamine (H 1 to 3 ), muscarinic (M 1 to 5 ), and benzodiazepine receptors. S-DCT and S-DDCT also do not bind to various ion channels including Na + , K + , Cl - , and Ca ++ channels. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the Ndemethylation of escitalopram. Population Subgroups Age Adolescents - In a single dose study of 10 mg escitalopram, AUC of escitalopram decreased by 19%, and C max increased by 26% in healthy adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age) compared to adults. Following multiple dosing of 40 mg/day citalopram, escitalopram elimination half-life, steady-state C max and AUC were similar in patients with MDD (12 to 17 years of age) compared to adult patients. No adjustment of dosage is needed in adolescent patients. Elderly - Escitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects ≥ 65 years of age were compared to younger subjects in a single-dose and a multiple-dose study. Escitalopram AUC and half-life were increased by approximately 50% in elderly subjects, and C max was unchanged. 10 mg is the recommended dose for elderly patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. Gender - Based on data from single- and multiple-dose studies measuring escitalopram in elderly, young adults, and adolescents, no dosage adjustment on the basis of gender is needed. Reduced hepatic function - Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 10 mg is the recommended dose of escitalopram for most hepatically impaired patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. Reduced renal function - In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min). Drug-Drug Interactions In vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of escitalopram on CYP3A4, -1A2, -2C9, -2C19, and -2E1. Based on in vitro data, escitalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. While in vivo data to address this question are limited, results from drug interaction studies suggest that escitalopram, at a dose of 20 mg, has no 3A4 inhibitory effect and a modest 2D6 inhibitory effect. See Drug Interactions ( 7.18 ) for more detailed information on available drug interaction data.",
        "dosage": "Escitalopram tablets should generally be administered once daily , morning or evening with or without food ( 2.1 , 2.2 ). Indication Recommended Dose MDD in Adolescents ( 2.1 ) Initial: 10 mg once daily Recommended: 10 mg once daily Maximum: 20 mg once daily MDD in Adults ( 2.1 ) Initial: 10 mg once daily Recommended: 10 mg once daily Maximum: 20 mg once daily GAD in Adults ( 2.2 ) Initial: 10 mg once daily Recommended: 10 mg once daily No additional benefits seen at 20 mg/day dose ( 2.1 ). 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment ( 2.3 ). No dosage adjustment for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Use caution in patients with severe renal impairment ( 2.3 ). Discontinuing escitalopram tablets: A gradual dose reduction is recommended ( 2.4 ). Escitalopram tablets should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food. 2.1 Major Depressive Disorder Initial Treatment Adolescents The recommended dose of escitalopram tablets is 10 mg once daily. A flexible-dose trial of escitalopram tablets (10 to 20 mg/day) demonstrated the effectiveness of escitalopram tablets [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of three weeks. Adults The recommended dose of escitalopram tablets is 10 mg once daily. A fixed-dose trial of escitalopram demonstrated the effectiveness of both 10 mg and 20 mg of escitalopram, but failed to demonstrate a greater benefit of 20 mg over 10 mg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week. Maintenance Treatment It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depressive disorder require several months or longer of sustained pharmacological therapy beyond response to the acute episode. Systematic evaluation of continuing escitalopram 10 or 20 mg/day in adults patients with major depressive disorder who responded while taking escitalopram during an 8-week, acute-treatment phase demonstrated a benefit of such maintenance treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use escitalopram for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 2.2 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Initial Treatment Adults The recommended starting dose of escitalopram tablets is 10 mg once daily. If the dose is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of one week. Maintenance Treatment Generalized anxiety disorder is recognized as a chronic condition. The efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. The physician who elects to use escitalopram for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. 2.3 Special Populations 10 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Escitalopram tablets should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment with Escitalopram Tablets Symptoms associated with discontinuation of escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. 2.5 Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with escitalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping escitalopram tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) ]. 2.6 Use of Escitalopram Tablet with Other MAOIs such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue Do not start escitalopram tablets in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered [ see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) ]. In some cases, a patient already receiving escitalopram tablets therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, escitalopram tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with escitalopram tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with escitalopram tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "7.12 Theophylline Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated. 7.13 Warfarin Administration of 40 mg/day racemic citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown. 7.14 Carbamazepine Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of escitalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. 7.15 Triazolam Combined administration of racemic citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam. 7.16 Ketoconazole Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 7.17 Ritonavir Combined administration of a single dose of ritonavir (600 mg), both a CYP3A4 substrate and a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and escitalopram (20 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either ritonavir or escitalopram. 7.18 CYP3A4 and -2C19 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and -2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of escitalopram. However, coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg) and ritonavir (600 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram. Because escitalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease escitalopram clearance. 7.19 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P4502D6 In vitro studies did not reveal an inhibitory effect of escitalopram on CYP2D6. In addition, steady state levels of racemic citalopram were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram, suggesting that coadministration, with escitalopram, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on escitalopram metabolism. However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in C max and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of escitalopram and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. 7.20 Metoprolol Administration of 20 mg/day escitalopram tablets for 21 days in healthy volunteers resulted in a 50% increase in C max and 82% increase in AUC of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol (given in a single dose of 100 mg). Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of escitalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.",

        "pharmGKB_ID": "PA166184495",
        "pharmacokinetics": "The results of a bioequivalence study in healthy subjects demonstrated that the VYTORIN 10 mg/10 mg to 10 mg/80 mg combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of ezetimibe (ZETIA ® ) and simvastatin (ZOCOR ® ) as individual tablets. Absorption Ezetimibe After oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a pharmacologically active phenolic glucuronide (ezetimibe-glucuronide). Simvastatin The availability of the ß-hydroxyacid to the systemic circulation following an oral dose of simvastatin was found to be less than 5% of the dose, consistent with extensive hepatic first-pass extraction. Effect of Food on Oral Absorption Ezetimibe Concomitant food administration (high-fat or non-fat meals) had no effect on the extent of absorption of ezetimibe when administered as 10-mg tablets. The C max value of ezetimibe was increased by 38% with consumption of high-fat meals. Simvastatin Relative to the fasting state, the plasma profiles of both active and total inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase were not affected when simvastatin was administered immediately before an American Heart Association recommended low-fat meal. Distribution Ezetimibe Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are highly bound (>90%) to human plasma proteins. Simvastatin Both simvastatin and its ß-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (approximately 95%) to human plasma proteins. When radiolabeled simvastatin was administered to rats, simvastatin-derived radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Metabolism and Excretion Ezetimibe Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation with subsequent biliary and renal excretion. Minimal oxidative metabolism has been observed in all species evaluated. In humans, ezetimibe is rapidly metabolized to ezetimibe-glucuronide. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are the major drug-derived compounds detected in plasma, constituting approximately 10 to 20% and 80 to 90% of the total drug in plasma, respectively. Both ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are eliminated from plasma with a half-life of approximately 22 hours for both ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide. Plasma concentration-time profiles exhibit multiple peaks, suggesting enterohepatic recycling. Following oral administration of 14 C-ezetimibe (20 mg) to human subjects, total ezetimibe (ezetimibe + ezetimibe-glucuronide) accounted for approximately 93% of the total radioactivity in plasma. After 48 hours, there were no detectable levels of radioactivity in the plasma. Approximately 78% and 11% of the administered radioactivity were recovered in the feces and urine, respectively, over a 10-day collection period. Ezetimibe was the major component in feces and accounted for 69% of the administered dose, while ezetimibe-glucuronide was the major component in urine and accounted for 9% of the administered dose. Simvastatin Simvastatin is a lactone that is readily hydrolyzed in vivo to the corresponding ß-hydroxyacid, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase is a basis for an assay in pharmacokinetic studies of the ß-hydroxyacid metabolites (active inhibitors) and, following base hydrolysis, active plus latent inhibitors (total inhibitors) in plasma following administration of simvastatin. The major active metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are the ß-hydroxyacid of simvastatin and its 6'-hydroxy, 6'-hydroxymethyl, and 6'-exomethylene derivatives. Following an oral dose of 14 C-labeled simvastatin in man, 13% of the dose was excreted in urine and 60% in feces. Plasma concentrations of total radioactivity (simvastatin plus 14 C-metabolites) peaked at 4 hours and declined rapidly to about 10% of peak by 12 hours postdose. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Ezetimibe In a multiple-dose study with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days, plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were about 2-fold higher in older (≥65 years) healthy subjects compared to younger subjects. Simvastatin In a study including 16 elderly patients between 70 and 78 years of age who received simvastatin 40 mg/day, the mean plasma level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was increased approximately 45% compared with 18 patients between 18-30 years of age. Pediatric Patients: [See Pediatric Use (8.4) .] Gender Ezetimibe In a multiple-dose study with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days, plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were slightly higher (<20%) in women than in men. Race Ezetimibe Based on a meta-analysis of multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies, there were no pharmacokinetic differences between Black and Caucasian subjects. Studies in Asian subjects indicated that the pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe was similar to those seen in Caucasian subjects. Hepatic Impairment Ezetimibe After a single 10-mg dose of ezetimibe, the mean exposure (based on area under the curve [AUC]) to total ezetimibe was increased approximately 1.7-fold in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), compared to healthy subjects. The mean AUC values for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe increased approximately 3- to 4-fold and 5- to 6-fold, respectively, in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 10 to 15). In a 14-day, multiple-dose study (10 mg daily) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the mean AUC for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe increased approximately 4-fold compared to healthy subjects. Renal Impairment Ezetimibe After a single 10-mg dose of ezetimibe in patients with severe renal disease (n=8; mean CrCl ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the mean AUC for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe increased approximately 1.5-fold, compared to healthy subjects (n=9). Simvastatin Pharmacokinetic studies with another statin having a similar principal route of elimination to that of simvastatin have suggested that for a given dose level higher systemic exposure may be achieved in patients with severe renal impairment (as measured by creatinine clearance). Drug Interactions [See also Drug Interactions (7) .] No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was seen when ezetimibe was coadministered with simvastatin. No specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with VYTORIN have been conducted other than the following study with NIASPAN (Niacin extended-release tablets). Niacin: The effect of VYTORIN (10/20 mg daily for 7 days) on the pharmacokinetics of NIASPAN extended-release tablets (1000 mg for 2 days and 2000 mg for 5 days following a low-fat breakfast) was studied in healthy subjects. The mean C max and AUC of niacin increased 9% and 22%, respectively. The mean C max and AUC of nicotinuric acid increased 10% and 19%, respectively (N=13). In the same study, the effect of NIASPAN on the pharmacokinetics of VYTORIN was evaluated (N=15). While concomitant NIASPAN decreased the mean C max of total ezetimibe (1%), and simvastatin (2%), it increased the mean C max of simvastatin acid (18%). In addition, concomitant NIASPAN increased the mean AUC of total ezetimibe (26%), simvastatin (20%), and simvastatin acid (35%). Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been observed with simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day niacin) of niacin-containing products. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4) .] Cytochrome P450: Ezetimibe had no significant effect on a series of probe drugs (caffeine, dextromethorphan, tolbutamide, and IV midazolam) known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 (1A2, 2D6, 2C8/9 and 3A4) in a “cocktail” study of twelve healthy adult males. This indicates that ezetimibe is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of these cytochrome P450 isozymes, and it is unlikely that ezetimibe will affect the metabolism of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, simvastatin at the 80-mg dose had no effect on the metabolism of the probe cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates midazolam and erythromycin. This indicates that simvastatin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and, therefore, is not expected to affect the plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, cyclosporine has been shown to increase the AUC of statins. The increase in AUC for simvastatin acid is presumably due, in part, to inhibition of CYP3A4. Simvastatin is a substrate for CYP3A4. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 can raise the plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and increase the risk of myopathy.

( 2.7 , 7.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing The dosage range is 10/10 mg/day through 10/80 mg/day. The recommended usual starting dose is 10/20 mg/day. VYTORIN should be taken as a single daily dose in the evening, with or without food. Initiation of therapy with 10/10 mg/day may be considered for patients requiring less aggressive LDL-C reductions. Patients who require a larger reduction in LDL-C (greater than 55%) may be started at 10/40 mg/day. After initiation or titration of VYTORIN, lipid levels may be analyzed after 2 or more weeks and dosage adjusted, if needed. 2.2 Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended dosage for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is VYTORIN 10/40 mg/day or 10/80 mg/day in the evening. VYTORIN should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 2.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 2.4 Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, for patients with severe renal insufficiency, VYTORIN should not be started unless the patient has already tolerated treatment with simvastatin at a dose of 5 mg or higher. Caution should be exercised when VYTORIN is administered to these patients, and they should be closely monitored [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.5 Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Chinese Patients Taking Lipid-Modifying Doses (≥1 g/day Niacin) of Niacin-Containing Products Because of an increased risk for myopathy, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with VYTORIN coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day niacin) of niacin-containing products. Because the risk for myopathy is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive VYTORIN 10/80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. The cause of the increased risk of myopathy is not known. It is also unknown if the risk for myopathy with coadministration of simvastatin with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products observed in Chinese patients applies to other Asian patients.

Cyclosporine or Danazol Caution should be exercised when initiating VYTORIN in the setting of cyclosporine. In patients taking cyclosporine or danazol, VYTORIN should not be started unless the patient has already tolerated treatment with simvastatin at a dose of 5 mg or higher. The dose of VYTORIN should not exceed 10/10 mg/day [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ] .

Therefore, the combination of VYTORIN and fibrates should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.2 and 7.8) ] . There is an increased risk of myopathy when simvastatin is used concomitantly with fibrates (especially gemfibrozil). Combination therapy with gemfibrozil should be avoided because of an increase in simvastatin exposure with concomitant use.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "CYP3A4 Interactions The risk of myopathy is increased by reducing the elimination of the simvastatin component of VYTORIN. Hence when VYTORIN is used with an inhibitor of CYP3A4, elevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity can increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly with higher doses of VYTORIN.

        "pharmGKB_ID": "PA449683",
        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption The mean oral bioavailability of flurbiprofen from ANSAID Tablets 100 mg is 96% relative to an oral solution. Flurbiprofen is rapidly and non-stereoselectively absorbed from ANSAID, with peak plasma concentrations occurring at about 2 hours (see Table 1 ). Administration of ANSAID with either food or antacids may alter the rate but not the extent of flurbiprofen absorption. Ranitidine has been shown to have no effect on either the rate or extent of flurbiprofen absorption from ANSAID. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of both R- and S-flurbiprofen is approximately 0.12 L/Kg. Both flurbiprofen enantiomers are more than 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. Plasma protein binding is relatively constant for the typical average steady-state concentrations (≤10 µg/mL) achieved with recommended doses. Flurbiprofen is poorly excreted into human milk. The nursing infant dose is predicted to be approximately 0.1 mg/day in the established milk of a woman taking ANSAID 200 mg/day (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers ). Metabolism Several flurbiprofen metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. These metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3', 4'-dihydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-flurbiprofen, their conjugates, and conjugated flurbiprofen. Unlike other arylpropionic acid derivatives (e.g., ibuprofen), metabolism of R-flurbiprofen to S-flurbiprofen is minimal. In vitro studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) plays an important role in the metabolism of flurbiprofen to its major metabolite 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen (see Special Populations ). The 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen metabolite showed little anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of inflammation. In vitro studies also demonstrated glucuronidation of both enantiomers of flurbiprofen and 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen. UGT2B7 is the predominant UGT isozyme responsible for the glucuronidation. Flurbiprofen does not induce enzymes that alter its metabolism. The total plasma clearance of unbound flurbiprofen is not stereoselective, and clearance of flurbiprofen is independent of dose when used within the therapeutic range. Excretion Following dosing with ANSAID, less than 3% of flurbiprofen is excreted unchanged in the urine, with about 70% of the dose eliminated in the urine as flurbiprofen, 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, and their acyl-glucuronide conjugates. Because renal elimination is a significant pathway of elimination of flurbiprofen metabolites, dosing adjustment in patients with moderate or severe renal dysfunction may be necessary to avoid accumulation of flurbiprofen metabolites. The mean terminal disposition half-lives (t½) of R- and S-flurbiprofen are similar, about 4.7 and 5.7 hours, respectively. There is little accumulation of flurbiprofen following multiple doses of ANSAID. Table 1.

Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS ). After observing the response to initial therapy with ANSAID, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs. For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the recommended starting dose of ANSAID is 200 to 300 mg per day, divided for administration two, three, or four times a day. The largest recommended single dose in a multiple-dose daily regimen is 100 mg.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9) plays an important role in the metabolism of flurbiprofen to its major metabolite 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen (see Special Populations ). The 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen metabolite showed little anti-inflammatory activity in animal models of inflammation. In vitro studies also demonstrated glucuronidation of both enantiomers of flurbiprofen and 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen. UGT2B7 is the predominant UGT isozyme responsible for the glucuronidation. Flurbiprofen does not induce enzymes that alter its metabolism. Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates Patients who are known or suspected to be poor CYP2C9 metabolizers based on previous history/experience with other CYP2C9 substrates (such as warfarin and phenytoin) should be administered flurbiprofen with caution as they may have abnormally high plasma levels due to reduced metabolic clearance.",

        "pharmGKB_ID": "PA161199368",
        "pharmacokinetics": "The observed mean elimination half-lives for iloperidone, P88 and P95 in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EM) are 18, 26, and 23 hours, respectively, and in poor metabolizers (PM) are 33, 37 and 31 hours, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are attained within 3-4 days of dosing. Iloperidone accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of iloperidone is more than dose proportional. Elimination of iloperidone is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving 2 P450 isozymes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Absorption: Iloperidone is well absorbed after administration of the tablet with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 2 to 4 hours; while the relative bioavailability of the tablet formulation compared to oral solution is 96%. Administration of iloperidone with a standard high-fat meal did not significantly affect the C max or AUC of iloperidone, P88, or P95, but delayed T max by 1 hour for iloperidone, 2 hours for P88 and 6 hours for P95. FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals. Distribution: Iloperidone has an apparent clearance (clearance/bioavailability) of 47 to 102 L/h, with an apparent volume of distribution of 1340-2800 L. At therapeutic concentrations, the unbound fraction of iloperidone in plasma is ~3% and of each metabolite (P88 and P95) it is ~8%. Metabolism and Elimination: Iloperidone is metabolized primarily by 3 biotransformation pathways: carbonyl reduction, hydroxylation (mediated by CYP2D6) and O -demethylation (mediated by CYP3A4). There are 2 predominant iloperidone metabolites, P95 and P88. The iloperidone metabolite P95 represents 47.9% of the AUC of iloperidone and its metabolites in plasma at steady-state for extensive metabolizers (EM) and 25% for poor metabolizers (PM). The active metabolite P88 accounts for 19.5% and 34.0% of total plasma exposure in EM and PM, respectively. Approximately 7% - 10% of Caucasians and 3% - 8% of black/African Americans lack the capacity to metabolize CYP2D6 substrates and are classified as poor metabolizers (PM), whereas the rest are intermediate, extensive or ultrarapid metabolizers. Coadministration of FANAPT with known strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 like fluoxetine results in a 2.3-fold increase in iloperidone plasma exposure, and therefore one-half of the FANAPT dose should be administered. Similarly, PMs of CYP2D6 have higher exposure to iloperidone compared with EMs and PMs should have their dose reduced by one-half. Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs. The bulk of the radioactive materials were recovered in the urine (mean 58.2% and 45.1% in EM and PM, respectively), with feces accounting for 19.9% (EM) to 22.1% (PM) of the dosed radioactivity. Transporter Interaction: Iloperidone and P88 are not substrates of P-gp and iloperidone is a weak P-gp inhibitor.",
        "dosage": "The recommended target dosage of FANAPT tablets is 12 to 24 mg/day administered twice daily. This target dosage range is achieved by daily dosage adjustments, alerting patients to symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, starting at a dose of 1 mg twice daily, then moving to 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, and 12 mg twice daily on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively, to reach the 12 mg/day to 24 mg/day dose range. FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Usual Dose FANAPT must be titrated slowly from a low starting dose to avoid orthostatic hypotension due to its alpha-adrenergic blocking properties. The recommended starting dose for FANAPT tablets is 1 mg twice daily. Dose increases to reach the target range of 6-12 mg twice daily (12_24 mg/day) may be made with daily dosage adjustments not to exceed 2 mg twice daily (4 mg/day). The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg twice daily (24 mg/day). FANAPT doses above 24 mg/day have not been systematically evaluated in the clinical trials. Efficacy was demonstrated with FANAPT in a dose range of 6 to 12 mg twice daily. Prescribers should be mindful of the fact that patients need to be titrated to an effective dose of FANAPT. Thus, control of symptoms may be delayed during the first 1 to 2 weeks of treatment compared to some other antipsychotic drugs that do not require similar titration. Prescribers should also be aware that some adverse effects associated with FANAPT use are dose related. FANAPT can be administered without regard to meals. 2.2 Dosage in Special Populations Dosage adjustments are not routinely indicated on the basis of age, gender, race, or renal impairment status [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Dosage adjustment for patients taking FANAPT concomitantly with potential CYP2D6 inhibitors: FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half when administered concomitantly with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, FANAPT dose should then be increased to where it was before [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Dosage adjustment for patients taking FANAPT concomitantly with potential CYP3A4 inhibitors: FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half when administered concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, FANAPT dose should be increased to where it was before [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Dosage adjustment for patients taking FANAPT who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6: FANAPT dose should be reduced by one-half for poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 [see Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 )] . Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment to FANAPT is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Exercise caution when administering it to patients with moderate hepatic impairment. FANAPT is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . 2.3 Maintenance Treatment Although there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with FANAPT should be maintained, it is generally recommended that responding patients be continued beyond the acute response. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment. 2.4 Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued Although there are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment, it is recommended that the initiation titration schedule be followed whenever patients have had an interval off FANAPT of more than 3 days. 2.5 Switching from Other Antipsychotics There are no specific data to address how patients with schizophrenia can be switched from other antipsychotics to FANAPT or how FANAPT can be used concomitantly with other antipsychotics. Although immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients with schizophrenia, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "The dose of FANAPT should be reduced in patients co-administered a strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor. 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect FANAPT Iloperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 enzymes. This suggests that an interaction of iloperidone with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, or other factors, like smoking, is unlikely. Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for iloperidone metabolism. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) can inhibit iloperidone elimination and cause increased blood levels. Ketoconazole: Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 4 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, with a 3 mg single dose of iloperidone to 19 healthy volunteers, ages 18-45 years, increased the area under the curve (AUC) of iloperidone and its metabolites P88 and P95 by 57%, 55% and 35%, respectively. Iloperidone doses should be reduced by about one-half when administered with ketoconazole or other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole). Weaker inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level. Fluoxetine : Coadministration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice daily for 21 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, with a single 3 mg dose of iloperidone to 23 healthy volunteers, ages 29-44 years, who were classified as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, increased the AUC of iloperidone and its metabolite P88, by about 2- to 3-fold, and decreased the AUC of its metabolite P95 by one-half. Iloperidone doses should be reduced by one-half when administered with fluoxetine. When fluoxetine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 would be expected to have similar effects and would need appropriate dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, iloperidone dose could then be increased to the previous level. Paroxetine: Coadministration of paroxetine (20 mg/day for 5-8 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, with multiple doses of iloperidone (8 or 12 mg twice daily) to patients with schizophrenia ages 18-65 years resulted in increased mean steady-state peak concentrations of iloperidone and its metabolite P88, by about 1.6 fold, and decreased mean steady-state peak concentrations of its metabolite P95 by one-half. Iloperidone doses should be reduced by one-half when administered with paroxetine. When paroxetine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 would be expected to have similar effects and would need appropriate dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, iloperidone dose could then be increased to previous levels. Paroxetine and Ketoconazole: Coadministration of paroxetine (20 mg once daily for 10 days), a CYP2D6 inhibitor, and ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) with multiple doses of iloperidone (8 or 12 mg twice daily) to patients with schizophrenia ages 18-65 years resulted in a 1.4 fold increase in steady-state concentrations of iloperidone and its metabolite P88 and a 1.4 fold decrease in the P95 in the presence of paroxetine. So giving iloperidone with inhibitors of both of its metabolic pathways did not add to the effect of either inhibitor given alone. Iloperidone doses should therefore be reduced by about one-half if administered concomitantly with both a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor. 7.2 Potential for FANAPT to Affect Other Drugs In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that iloperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the following cytochrome P450 isozymes: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1. Furthermore, in vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that iloperidone does not have enzyme inducing properties, specifically for the following cytochrome P450 isozymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Dextromethorphan: A study in healthy volunteers showed that changes in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan (80 mg dose) when a 3 mg dose of iloperidone was co-administered resulted in a 17% increase in total exposure and a 26% increase in the maximum plasma concentrations C max of dextromethorphan. Thus, an interaction between iloperidone and other CYP2D6 substrates is unlikely. Fluoxetine: A single 3 mg dose of iloperidone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine (20 mg twice daily). Midazolam (a sensitive CYP 3A4 substrate): A study in patients with schizophrenia showed a less than 50% increase in midazolam total exposure at iloperidone steady state (14 days of oral dosing at up to 10 mg iloperidone twice daily) and no effect on midazolam C max . Thus, an interaction between iloperidone and other CYP3A4 substrates is unlikely.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans, irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half-life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite SN-38 is about 10 to 20 hours. The half-lives of the lactone (active) forms of irinotecan and SN-38 are similar to those of total irinotecan and SN-38, as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium. Over the recommended dose range of 50 to 350 mg/m 2 , the AUC of irinotecan increases linearly with dose; the AUC of SN-38 increases less than proportionally with dose. Maximum concentrations of the active metabolite SN-38 are generally seen within 1 hour following the end of a 90-minute infusion of irinotecan. Pharmacokinetic parameters for irinotecan and SN-38 following a 90-minute infusion of irinotecan at dose levels of 125 and 340 mg/m 2 determined in two clinical studies in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 9 : Table 9. Summary of Mean (± Standard Deviation) Irinotecan and SN-38 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients with Solid Tumors C max - Maximum plasma concentration AUC 0-24 - Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours after the end of the 90-minute infusion t 1/2 - Terminal elimination half-life V z - Volume of distribution of terminal elimination phase CL - Total systemic clearance a Plasma specimens collected for 24 hours following the end of the 90-minute infusion. b Plasma specimens collected for 48 hours following the end of the 90-minute infusion. Because of the longer collection period, these values provide a more accurate reflection of the terminal elimination half-lives of irinotecan and SN-38.

SN-38 is highly bound to human plasma proteins (approximately 95% bound). The plasma protein to which irinotecan and SN-38 predominantly binds is albumin. Metabolism Irinotecan is subject to extensive metabolic conversion by various enzyme systems, including esterases to form the active metabolite SN-38, and UGT1A1 mediating glucuronidation of SN-38 to form the inactive glucuronide metabolite SN-38G. Irinotecan can also undergo CYP3A4-mediated oxidative metabolism to several inactive oxidation products, one of which can be hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to release SN-38. In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan, SN-38 and another metabolite aminopentane carboxylic acid (APC), do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 isozymes. UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Approximately 10% of the North American population is homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele (also referred to as UGT1A1 7/7 genotype). In a prospective study, in which irinotecan was administered as a single-agent (350 mg/m2) on a once-every-3-week schedule, patients with the UGT1A1 7/7 genotype had a higher exposure to SN-38 than patients with the wild-type UGT1A1 allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . SN-38 glucuronide had 1/50 to 1/100 the activity of SN-38 in cytotoxicity assays using two cell lines in vitro . Excretion The disposition of irinotecan has not been fully elucidated in humans. The urinary excretion of irinotecan is 11% to 20%; SN-38, < 1%; and SN-38 glucuronide, 3%. The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide) over a period of 48 hours following administration of irinotecan in two patients ranged from approximately 25% (100 mg/m 2 ) to 50% (300 mg/m 2 ). Effect of Age The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan administered using the weekly schedule was evaluated in a study of 183 patients that was prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age on irinotecan toxicity. Results from this trial indicate that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38 glucuronide in patients < 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age. In a study of 162 patients that was not prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age, small (less than 18%) but statistically significant differences in dose-normalized irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters in patients < 65 years of age compared to patients ≥ 65 years of age were observed. Although dose-normalized AUC 0-24 for SN-38 in patients ≥ 65 years of age was 11% higher than in patients < 65 years of age, this difference was not statistically significant. No change in the starting dose is recommended for geriatric patients receiving the weekly dosage schedule of irinotecan [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] . Effect of Gender The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan do not appear to be influenced by gender. Effect of Race The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated. Effect of Hepatic Impairment Irinotecan clearance is diminished in patients with hepatic impairment while exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 is increased relative to that in patients with normal hepatic function. The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations. However, the tolerability of irinotecan in patients with hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dl) has not been assessed sufficiently, and no recommendations for dosing can be made [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Effect of Renal Impairment The influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated. Therefore, caution should be undertaken in patients with impaired renal function. Irinotecan is not recommended for use in patients on dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Drug Interactions Dexamethasone, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan.",

However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known, and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment (see Tables 1 to 4 ). 2.4 Premedication It is recommended that patients receive premedication with antiemetic agents. In clinical studies of the weekly dosage schedule, the majority of patients received 10 mg of dexamethasone given in conjunction with another type of antiemetic agent, such as a 5-HT 3 blocker (e.g., ondansetron or granisetron). Antiemetic agents should be given on the day of treatment, starting at least 30 minutes before administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Physicians should also consider providing patients with an antiemetic regimen (e.g., prochlorperazine) for subsequent use as needed. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of atropine should be considered in patients experiencing cholinergic symptoms. 2.5 Preparation of Infusion Solution Inspect vial contents for particulate matter and discoloration and repeat inspection when drug product is withdrawn from vial into syringe. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection 20 mg/mL is intended for single use only and any unused portion should be discarded. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection must be diluted prior to infusion. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, (preferred) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final concentration range of 0.12 mg/mL to 2.8 mg/mL. Other drugs should not be added to the infusion solution. The solution is physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature and in ambient fluorescent lighting. Solutions diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and stored at refrigerated temperatures (approximately 2° to 8°C, 36° to 46°F), and protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 hours. Refrigeration of admixtures using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, is not recommended due to a low and sporadic incidence of visible particulates. Freezing irinotecan hydrochloride injection and admixtures of irinotecan hydrochloride injection may result in precipitation of the drug and should be avoided. The irinotecan hydrochloride injection solution should be used immediately after reconstitution as it contains no antibacterial preservative. Because of possible microbial contamination during dilution, it is advisable to use the admixture prepared with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, within 24 hours if refrigerated (2° to 8°C, 36° to 46°F). In the case of admixtures prepared with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the solutions should be used within 4 hours if kept at room temperature. If reconstitution and dilution are performed under strict aseptic conditions (e.g., on Laminar Air Flow bench), irinotecan hydrochloride injection solution should be used (infusion completed) within 12 hours at room temperature or 24 hours if refrigerated (2° to 8°C, 36° to 46°F). 2.6 Safe Handling Care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion solutions prepared from irinotecan hydrochloride injection. The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of irinotecan hydrochloride injection contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If irinotecan hydrochloride injection contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Several published guidelines for handling and disposal of anticancer agents are available. 2.7 Extravasation Care should be taken to avoid extravasation, and the infusion site should be monitored for signs of inflammation. Should extravasation occur, flushing the site with sterile water and applications of ice are recommended.",

The initial dose is usually 3 to 5 mg/kg daily, beginning at the time of transplant. Azathioprine tablets are usually given as a single daily dose on the day of, and in a minority of cases 1 to 3 days before, transplantation. Dose reduction to maintenance levels of 1 to 3 mg/kg daily is usually possible. The dose of azathioprine tablets should not be increased to toxic levels because of threatened rejection. Discontinuation may be necessary for severe hematologic or other toxicity, even if rejection of the homograft may be a consequence of drug withdrawal. Rheumatoid Arthritis Azathioprine tablets are usually given on a daily basis. The initial dose should be approximately 1.0 mg/kg (50 to 100 mg) given as a single dose or on a twice-daily schedule. The dose may be increased, beginning at 6 to 8 weeks and thereafter by steps at 4-week intervals, if there are no serious toxicities and if initial response is unsatisfactory. Dose increments should be 0.5 mg/kg daily, up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg/kg per day. Therapeutic response occurs after several weeks of treatment, usually 6 to 8; an adequate trial should be a minimum of 12 weeks. Patients not improved after 12 weeks can be considered refractory. Azathioprine tablets may be continued long-term in patients with clinical response, but patients should be monitored carefully, and gradual dosage reduction should be attempted to reduce risk of toxicities. Maintenance therapy should be at the lowest effective dose, and the dose given can be lowered decrementally with changes of 0.5 mg/kg or approximately 25 mg daily every 4 weeks while other therapy is kept constant. The optimum duration of maintenance azathioprine tablets has not been determined. Azathioprine tablets can be discontinued abruptly, but delayed effects are possible. Use in Renal Dysfunction Relatively oliguric patients, especially those with tubular necrosis in the immediate postcadaveric transplant period, may have delayed clearance of azathioprine tablets or its metabolites, may be particularly sensitive to this drug, and are usually given lower doses. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of this immunosuppressive antimetabolite drug should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 25-31 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "TPMT TESTING CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) MONITORING IN PATIENTS RECEIVING AZATHIOPRINE TABLETS. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping can be used to identify patients with absent or reduced TPMT activity. Patients with low or absent TPMT activity are at an increased risk of developing severe, life-threatening myelotoxicity from azathioprine tablets if conventional doses are given. Physicians may consider alternative therapies for patients who have low or absent TPMT activity (homozygous for non-functional alleles). Azathioprine tablets should be administered with caution to patients having one non-functional allele (heterozygous) who are at risk for reduced TPMT activity that may lead to toxicity if conventional doses are given. Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with reduced TPMT activity. Early drug discontinuation may be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving azathioprine tablets and allopurinol because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected. Use with Aminosalicylates There is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., sulphasalazine, mesalazine, or olsalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme. Concomitant use of these agents with azathioprine tablets should be done with caution. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioionosine monophosphate (6MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption Relative to an intravenous dose of 20 mg, the absolute bioavailability of oral metoclopramide is 80% ± 15.5% as demonstrated in a crossover study of 18 subjects. Peak plasma concentrations occurred at about 1 to 2 hours after a single oral dose. Similar time to peak was observed after individual doses at steady state. In a single dose study of 12 subjects, the area under the drug concentration-time curve increased linearly with doses from 20 to 100 mg (5 times the maximum recommended single dose). Peak concentrations increased linearly with dose; time to peak concentrations remained the same; whole body clearance was unchanged; and the elimination rate remained the same. The mean elimination half-life in subjects with normal renal function was 5 to 6 hours. Linear kinetic processes adequately describe the absorption and elimination of metoclopramide. Distribution Metoclopramide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 30%). The whole body volume of distribution is high (about 3.5 L/kg), which suggests extensive distribution of drug to the tissues. Elimination Metabolism: Metoclopramide undergoes enzymatic metabolism via oxidation as well as glucuronide and sulfate conjugation reactions in the liver. Monodeethylmetoclopramide, a major oxidative metabolite, is formed primarily by CYP2D6, an enzyme subject to genetic variability [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.9 ) ]. Excretion: Approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose appeared in the urine within 72 hours. After oral administration of 10 or 20 mg, a mean of 18% and 22% of the dose, respectively, was recovered as free metoclopramide in urine within 36 hours. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment: In a study of 24 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment (moderate, severe, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis), the systemic exposure (AUC) of metoclopramide in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment was about 2-fold the AUC in subjects with normal renal function. The AUC of metoclopramide in patients with ESRD on dialysis was about 3.5-fold the AUC in subjects with normal renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In a group of 8 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the average metoclopramide clearance was reduced by approximately 50% compared to patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Metoclopramide on CYP2D6 Substrates Although in vitro studies suggest that metoclopramide can inhibit CYP2D6, metoclopramide is unlikely to interact with CYP2D6 substrates in vivo at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Effect of CYP2D6 Inhibitors on Metoclopramide In healthy subjects, 20 mg of metoclopramide and 60 mg of fluoxetine (a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) were administered, following prior exposure to 60 mg fluoxetine orally for 8 days. The patients who received concomitant metoclopramide and fluoxetine had a 40% and 90% increase in metoclopramide C max and AUC 0-∞ , respectively, compared to patients who received metoclopramide alone (see Table 5) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ].

        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption For DILANTIN-125 Suspension, peak levels occur 1½ to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes.",
        "dosage": "Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is 5mL three times daily, with dose adjustments as necessary, up to 25 mL daily. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments—the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in DILANTIN-125 Suspension and DILANTIN Infatabs. DILANTIN extended capsules and parenteral DILANTIN are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the DILANTIN dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction.",

        "dosage": "General The suppression of tics by ORAP requires a slow and gradual introduction of the drug. The patient’s dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of tics and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug. An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests ). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of ORAP to see whether or not tics persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of ORAP, consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal-related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case. Children Reliable dose response data for the effects of ORAP (pimozide) on tic manifestation in Tourette’s Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available. Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day. At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, ORAP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics ). Adults In general, treatment with ORAP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day. Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, or 10 mg/day, whichever is less. Doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day are not recommended. At doses above 4 mg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed.

The time to achieve steady state pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life.

Food Effect No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant were observed following administration with a high-fat meal. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of pitolisant is approximately 700 L (5 to 10 L/kg). Serum protein binding is approximately 91% to 96%. The blood to plasma ratio of pitolisant is 0.55 to 0.89. Elimination After a single dose of 35.6 mg, the median half-life of pitolisant is approximately 20 hours (7.5 to 24.2 hours). The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of pitolisant is 43.9 L/hr and renal clearance accounts for <2% of the total clearance of pitolisant. Metabolism Pitolisant is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4; these metabolites are further metabolized or conjugated with glycine or glucuronic acid. None of these metabolites are pharmacologically active.

Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant were observed based on age (18 to 82 years old), sex, race/ethnicity (Caucasians or Blacks), or body weight (48 to 103 kg). The effects of end-stage renal disease and severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant are unknown. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Six subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), and 12 healthy subjects matched for age, sex, body mass index and ethnicity received a single dose of WAKIX 17.8 mg to assess the pharmacokinetics of WAKIX in patients with hepatic impairment. Exposure of pitolisant in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment is summarized in Figure 1 . No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

        "dosage": "Administer once daily in the morning upon wakening. The recommended dosage range is 17.8 mg to 35.6 mg daily. Titrate dosage as follows: Week 1: Initiate with 8.9 mg once daily Week 2: Increase dosage to 17.8 mg once daily Week 3: May increase to the maximum recommended dosage of 35.6 mg once daily ( 2.1 ) Hepatic impairment ( 2.2 , 8.6 , 12.3 ): Moderate hepatic impairment: Initial dosage is 8.9 mg once daily. Titrate to a maximum dosage of 17.8 mg once daily after 14 days Renal impairment ( 2.3 , 8.7 , 12.3 ): Moderate and severe impairment: Initial dosage is 8.9 mg once daily. Titrate to maximum dosage of 17.8 mg once daily after 7 days End−stage renal disease (ESRD): Not recommended Poor Metabolizers of CYP2D6: Maximum recommended dosage is 17.8 mg once daily ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage range for WAKIX is 17.8 mg to 35.6 mg administered orally once daily in the morning upon wakening. Titrate dosage as follows: Week 1: Initiate with a dosage of 8.9 mg (two 4.45 mg tablets) once daily Week 2: Increase dosage to 17.8 mg (one 17.8 mg tablet) once daily Week 3: May increase to the maximum recommended dosage of 35.6 mg (two 17.8 mg tablets) once daily Dose may be adjusted based on tolerability. If a dose is missed, patients should take the next dose the following day in the morning upon wakening. It may take up to 8 weeks for some patients to achieve a clinical response. 2.2 Dosage Modification and Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, initiate WAKIX at 8.9 mg once daily and increase after 14 days to a maximum dosage of 17.8 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . WAKIX is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. WAKIX has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.3 Dosage Modification and Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and End-Stage Renal Disease In patients with moderate (eGFR of 30 to 59 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) and severe renal impairment (eGFR of 15 to 29 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ), initiate WAKIX at 8.9 mg once daily and increase after 7 days to a maximum dosage of 17.8 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . WAKIX is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (eGFR of <15 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.4 Dosage Recommendations for Concomitant Use with Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors For patients receiving strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, initiate WAKIX at 8.9 mg once daily and increase after 7 days to a maximum dosage of 17.8 mg once daily. For patients on a stable dose of WAKIX, reduce the WAKIX dose by half upon initiating strong CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant use of WAKIX with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases pitolisant exposure by 50%. Assess for loss of efficacy after initiation of a strong CYP3A4 inducer. For patients stable on WAKIX 8.9 mg or 17.8 mg once daily, increase the dose of WAKIX to double the original daily dose (i.e., 17.8 mg or 35.6 mg, respectively) over 7 days. If concomitant dosing of a strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, decrease WAKIX dosage by half [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.5 Use in Patients Who Are Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers (PMs) In patients known to be poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, initiate WAKIX at 8.9 mg once daily and titrate to a maximum dose of 17.8 mg once daily after 7 days.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Maximum recommended dosage is 17.8 mg once daily ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Decreased exposure of WAKIX; consider dosage adjustment ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates (including hormonal contraceptives): WAKIX may reduce effectiveness of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. Use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method during treatment with WAKIX and for at least 21 days after discontinuation of treatment ( 7.1 , 8.3 ) 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with WAKIX Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with WAKIX Effect of Other Drugs on WAKIX Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors Clinical Implication: Concomitant administration of WAKIX with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increases pitolisant exposure by 2.2-fold. Prevention or Management: Reduce the dose of WAKIX by half [see see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Examples: paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of WAKIX with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases exposure of pitolisant by 50%. Prevention or Management: Assess for loss of efficacy after initiation of a strong CYP3A4 inducer. For patients stable on WAKIX 8.9 mg or 17.8 mg once daily, increase the dose of WAKIX to reach double the original daily dose (i.e., 17.8 mg or 35.6 mg, respectively) over 7 days. If concomitant dosing of a strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, decrease WAKIX dosage by half [see see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Examples: rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin Histamine-1 (H1) Receptor Antagonists Clinical Implication: WAKIX increases the levels of histamine in the brain; therefore, H1 receptor antagonists that cross the blood-brain barrier may reduce the effectiveness of WAKIX. Prevention or Management: Avoid centrally acting H1 receptor antagonists. Examples: pheniramine maleate, diphenhydramine, promethazine (anti-histamines) imipramine, clomipramine, mirtazapine (tri or tetracyclic antidepressants) QT Interval Prolongation Clinical Implication: Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval may add to the QT effects of WAKIX and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Prevention or Management: Avoid the use of WAKIX in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Examples: Class 1A antiarrhythmics: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide; Class 3 antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, sotalol; Antipsychotics: ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine; Antibiotics: moxifloxacin Effect of WAKIX on Other Drugs Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates Clinical Implication: WAKIX is a borderline/weak inducer of CYP3A4. Therefore, reduced effectiveness of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may occur when used concomitantly with WAKIX [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may be reduced when used with WAKIX and effectiveness may be reduced for 21 days after discontinuation of therapy. Prevention or Management: Patients using hormonal contraception should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method during treatment with WAKIX and for at least 21 days after discontinuation of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]. Examples: midazolam, hormonal contraceptives, cyclosporine 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with WAKIX A clinical study was conducted to evaluate the concomitant use of WAKIX with modafinil or sodium oxybate. This study demonstrated no clinically relevant effect of modafinil or sodium oxybate on the pharmacokinetics of WAKIX and no effect of WAKIX on the pharmacokinetics of modafinil or sodium oxybate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . A clinical study showed that strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, grapefruit juice) have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of WAKIX.",

        "pharmGKB_ID": "PA166182736",
        "pharmacokinetics": "Siponimod concentration increases in an apparent dose-proportional manner after multiple once-daily doses of siponimod 0.3 mg to 20 mg. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached after approximately 6 days of once-daily dosing, and steady-state levels are approximately 2-3-fold greater than the initial dose. An up-titration regimen is used to reach the clinical therapeutic dose of siponimod of 2 mg after 6 days, and 4 additional days of dosing are required to reach the steady-state-plasma concentrations. Absorption The time (T max ) to reach maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) after oral administration of immediate release oral dosage forms of siponimod was about 4 hours (range, 3-8 hours). Siponimod absorption is extensive (greater than or equal to 70%, based on the amount of radioactivity excreted in urine and the amount of metabolites in feces extrapolated to infinity). The absolute oral bioavailability of siponimod is approximately 84%. After administration of siponimod 2 mg once-daily over 10 days, a mean C max of 30.4 ng/mL and mean area under plasma concentration-time curve over dosing interval (AUC tau ) of 558 h*ng/mL were observed on Day 10. Steady-state was reached after approximately 6 days of once-daily administration of siponimod. Food Effect Food intake resulted in delayed absorption (the median T max increased by approximately 2-3 hours). Food intake had no effect on the systemic exposure of siponimod (C max and AUC). Therefore, MAYZENT may be taken without regard to meals. Distribution Siponimod distributes to body tissues with a moderate mean volume of distribution of 124 L. Siponimod fraction found in plasma is 68% in humans. Animal studies show that siponimod readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier. Protein binding of siponimod is greater than 99.9% in healthy subjects and in hepatic and renal impaired patients. Elimination Metabolism Siponimod is extensively metabolized, mainly via CYP2C9 (79.3%), followed by CYP3A4 (18.5%). The pharmacological activity of the main metabolites M3 and M17 is not expected to contribute to the clinical effect and the safety of siponimod in humans. Excretion An apparent systemic clearance (CL/F) of 3.11 L/h was estimated in MS patients. The apparent elimination half-life is approximately 30 hours. Siponimod is eliminated from the systemic circulation mainly due to metabolism, and subsequent biliary/fecal excretion. Unchanged siponimod was not detected in urine. Specific Populations Male and Female Patients Gender has no influence on siponimod pharmacokinetics (PK). Racial or Ethnic Groups The single-dose PK parameters were not different between Japanese and Caucasians healthy subjects, indicating absence of ethnic sensitivity on the PK of siponimod. Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment. Mean siponimod half-life and C max (total and unbound) were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. Unbound AUCs were only slightly increased (by 33%), compared to healthy subjects, and it is not expected to be clinically significant. The effects of end-stage renal disease or hemodialysis on the PK of siponimod has not been studied. Due to the high plasma protein binding (greater than 99.9%) of siponimod, hemodialysis is not expected to alter the total and unbound siponimod concentration and no dose adjustments are anticipated based on these considerations. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustments for siponimod are needed in patients with hepatic impairment. The unbound siponimod AUC parameters are 15% and 50% higher in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, in comparison with healthy subjects for the 0.25 mg single dose studied. The increased unbound siponimod AUC in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not expected to be clinically significant. The mean half-life of siponimod was unchanged in hepatic impairment. Drug Interaction Studies Siponimod (and Metabolites M3, M17) as a Causative Agent of Interaction In vitro investigations indicated that siponimod and its major systemic metabolites M3 and M17 do not show any clinically relevant drug-drug interaction potential at the therapeutic dose of 2 mg once-daily for all investigated CYP enzymes and transporters. Siponimod as an Object of Interaction CYP2C9 is polymorphic and the genotype influences the fractional contributions of the two oxidative metabolism pathways to overall elimination. Physiologically based PK modeling indicates a differential CYP2C9 genotype-dependent inhibition and induction of CYP3A4 pathways. With decreased CYP2C9 metabolic activity in the respective genotypes, a larger effect of the CYP3A4 perpetrators on siponimod exposure is anticipated. Coadministration of Siponimod with CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors The coadministration of fluconazole (moderate CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 dual inhibitor) 200 mg daily at steady-state and a single dose of siponimod 4 mg in CYP2C9*1/*1 healthy volunteers led to a 2-fold increase in the AUC of siponimod. Mean siponimod terminal half-life was increased by 50%. Fluconazole led to a 2- to 4-fold increase in the AUC tau,ss of siponimod across different CYP2C9 genotypes, according to in silico evaluation [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . Coadministration of Siponimod with CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inducers The coadministration of siponimod 2 mg daily in the presence of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin (strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9 dual inducer) decreased siponimod AUC tau,ss and C max,ss by 57% and 45%, respectively in CY2C9*1/*1 subjects. Rifampin and efavirenz (moderate CYP3A4 inducer) reduced the AUC tau,ss of siponimod by up to 78% and up to 52%, respectively, across CYP2C9 genotypes, according to in silico evaluation [see Drug Interactions (7.6)] . Oral Contraceptives The effects of coadministration of siponimod 2 mg and 4 mg (twice the recommended dosage) once daily with a monophasic oral contraceptive (OC) containing 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg levonorgestrel were assessed in 24 healthy female subjects (18 to 40 years of age; CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype). There were no clinically relevant effects on the PK or PD of the OC. No interaction studies have been performed with OCs containing other progestagens; however, an effect of siponimod on their exposure is not expected.",
        "dosage": " Assessments are required prior to initiating MAYZENT. ( 2.1 ) Titration is required for treatment initiation. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) The recommended maintenance dosage is 2 mg.

( 2.2 , 2.3 ) First-dose monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia, first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] atrioventricular (AV) block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Assessments Prior to First Dose of MAYZENT Before initiation of treatment with MAYZENT, assess the following: CYP2C9 Genotype Determination Test patients for CYP2C9 variants to determine CYP2C9 genotype [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Contraindications (4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . An FDA-cleared or -approved test for the detection of CYP2C9 variants to direct the use of siponimod is not currently available. Complete Blood Count Review results of a recent complete blood count (CBC) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Ophthalmic Evaluation Obtain an evaluation of the fundus, including the macula [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Cardiac Evaluation Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In patients with certain preexisting conditions, advice from a cardiologist and first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Determine whether patients are taking drugs that could slow heart rate or atrioventricular (AV) conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)] . Current or Prior Medications If patients are taking anti-neoplastic, immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies, or if there is a history of prior use of these drugs, consider possible unintended additive immunosuppressive effects before initiating treatment with MAYZENT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Vaccinations Test patients for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (VZV) before initiating MAYZENT; VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with MAYZENT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Liver Function Tests Obtain recent (i.e., within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] . 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Patients With CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2 Maintenance Dosage After treatment titration ( see Treatment Initiation ), the recommended maintenance dosage of MAYZENT is 2 mg taken orally once daily starting on Day 6. Dosage adjustment is required in patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Administer tablets whole; do not split, crush, or chew MAYZENT tablets. Treatment Initiation Initiate MAYZENT with a 5-day titration, as shown in Table 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . A starter pack should be used for patients who will be titrated to the 2-mg maintenance dosage [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1, 16.2)] . Table 1 Dose Titration Regimen to Reach MAYZENT 2 mg Maintenance Dosage Titration Titration Dose Titration Regimen Day 1 0.25 mg 1 x 0.25 mg Day 2 0.25 mg 1 x 0.25 mg Day 3 0.50 mg 2 x 0.25 mg Day 4 0.75 mg 3 x 0.25 mg Day 5 1.25 mg 5 x 0.25 mg If one titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment needs to be reinitiated with Day 1 of the titration regimen. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients With CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*3 or *2/*3 Maintenance Dosage In patients with a CYP2C9*1/*3 or *2/*3 genotype, after treatment titration ( see Treatment Initiation ), the recommended maintenance dosage of MAYZENT is 1 mg taken orally once daily starting on Day 5. Administer tablets whole; do not split, crush, or chew MAYZENT tablets. Treatment Initiation Initiate MAYZENT with a 4-day titration, as shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Do not use the starter pack for patients who will be titrated to the 1-mg maintenance dosage.

First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring Administer the first dose of MAYZENT in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period. Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves: The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose. Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with MAYZENT is considered in patients: With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2)] Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)] 2.5 Reinitiation of MAYZENT After Treatment Interruption After the initial titration is complete, if MAYZENT treatment is interrupted for 4 or more consecutive daily doses, reinitiate treatment with Day 1 of the titration regimen [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] ; also complete first-dose monitoring in patients for whom it is recommended.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Increase in siponimod exposure; concomitant use of MAYZENT with moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. ( 7.5 ) CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inducers: Decrease in siponimod exposure; concomitant use of MAYZENT with moderate CYP2C9 and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. ( 7.6 ) 7.1 Anti-Neoplastic, Immune-Modulating, or Immunosuppressive Therapies MAYZENT has not been studied in combination with anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or immunosuppressive therapies. Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the risk of additive immune effects during such therapy and in the weeks following administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered in order to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] . Because of the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects, initiating treatment with MAYZENT after alemtuzumab is not recommended. MAYZENT can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of beta interferon or glatiramer acetate. 7.2 Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs, QT Prolonging Drugs, Drugs That May Decrease Heart Rate MAYZENT has not been studied in patients taking QT prolonging drugs. Class Ia (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with cases of Torsades de Pointes in patients with bradycardia. If treatment with MAYZENT is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought. Because of the potential additive effects on heart rate, treatment with MAYZENT should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with QT prolonging drugs with known arrhythmogenic properties, heart rate lowering calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem), or other drugs that may decrease heart rate (e.g., ivabradine, digoxin) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.3)] . If treatment with MAYZENT is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non-heart-rate lowering drugs or appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation. 7.3 Beta-Blockers Caution should be applied when MAYZENT is initiated in patients receiving treatment with a beta-blocker because of the additive effects on lowering heart rate; temporary interruption of the beta-blocker treatment may be needed prior to initiation of MAYZENT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Beta-blocker treatment can be initiated in patients receiving stable doses of MAYZENT [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 7.4 Vaccination During and for up to one month after discontinuation of treatment with MAYZENT, vaccinations may be less effective; therefore MAYZENT treatment should be paused 1 week prior and for 4 weeks after vaccination [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry the risk of infection and should therefore be avoided during MAYZENT treatment and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment with MAYZENT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7.5 CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors Because of a significant increase in exposure to siponimod, concomitant use of MAYZENT and drugs that cause moderate CYP2C9 and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibition is not recommended. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of a moderate CYP2C9/CYP3A4 dual inhibitor (e.g., fluconazole) or a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor in combination with a separate - moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Caution should be exercised for concomitant use of MAYZENT with moderate CYP2C9 inhibitors. 7.6 CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 Inducers Because of a significant decrease in siponimod exposure, concomitant use of MAYZENT and drugs that cause moderate CYP2C9 and strong CYP3A4 induction is not recommended for all patients. This concomitant drug regimen can consist of moderate CYP2C9/strong CYP3A4 dual inducer (e.g., rifampin or carbamazepine) or a moderate CYP2C9 inducer in combination with a separate strong CYP3A4 inducer. Caution should be exercised for concomitant use of MAYZENT with moderate CYP2C9 inducers. Concomitant use of MAYZENT and moderate (e.g., modafinil, efavirenz) or strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended for patients with CYP2C9*1/*3 and *2/*3 genotype.",

        "pharmacokinetics": "Absorption Following oral administration of tetrabenazine, the extent of absorption is at least 75%. After single oral doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 mg, plasma concentrations of tetrabenazine are generally below the limit of detection because of the rapid and extensive hepatic metabolism of tetrabenazine by carbonyl reductase to the active metabolites α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are metabolized principally by CYP2D6. Peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are reached within 1 to 1½ hours post-dosing. α-HTBZ is subsequently metabolized to a minor metabolite, 9-desmethyl-α-DHTBZ. β-HTBZ is subsequently, metabolized to another major circulating metabolite, 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ, for which Cmax is reached approximately 2 hours post-dosing. Food Effects The effects of food on the bioavailability of Tetrabenazine tablet were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. Food had no effect on mean plasma concentrations, C max , or the area under the concentration time course (AUC) of α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Distribution Results of PET-scan studies in humans show that radioactivity is rapidly distributed to the brain following intravenous injection of 11 C-labeled tetrabenazine or α-HTBZ, with the highest binding in the striatum and lowest binding in the cortex. The in vitro protein binding of tetrabenazine, α-HTBZ, and β-HTBZ was examined in human plasma for concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 ng/mL. Tetrabenazine binding ranged from 82% to 85%, α-HTBZ binding ranged from 60% to 68%, and β-HTBZ binding ranged from 59% to 63%. Metabolism After oral administration in humans, at least 19 metabolites of tetrabenazine have been identified. α-HTBZ, β-HTBZ and 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ, are the major circulating metabolites, and they are, subsequently, metabolized to sulfate or glucuronide conjugates. α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are formed by carbonyl reductase that occurs mainly in the liver. α-HTBZ is O-dealkylated by CYP450 enzymes, principally CYP2D6, with some contribution of CYP1A2 to form 9-desmethyl-α-DHTBZ, a minor metabolite. β-HTBZ is O-dealkylated principally by CYP2D6 to form 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ. The results of in vitro studies do not suggest that tetrabenazine, α-HTBZ, or β-HTBZ are likely to result in clinically significant inhibition of CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A. In vitro studies suggest that neither tetrabenazine nor its α- or β-HTBZ metabolites are likely to result in clinically significant induction of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19. Neither tetrabenazine nor its α- or β-HTBZ metabolites is likely to be a substrate or inhibitor of P-glyco- protein at clinically relevant concentrations in vivo . No in vitro metabolism studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential of the 9-desmethyl-β- DHTBZ metabolite to interact with other drugs. The activity of this metabolite relative to the parent drug is unknown. Elimination After oral administration, tetrabenazine is extensively hepatically metabolized, and the metabolites are primarily renally eliminated. α-HTBZ, β-HTBZ and 9-desmethyl-β-DHTBZ have half-lives of 7 hours, 5 hours and 12 hours respectively. In a mass balance study in 6 healthy volunteers, approximately 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine and fecal recovery accounted for approximately 7-16% of the dose. Unchanged tetrabenazine has not been found in human urine. Urinary excretion of α-HTBZ or β- HTBZ accounted for less than 10% of the administered dose. Circulating metabolites, including sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of HTBZ metabolites as well as products of oxidative metabolism, account for the majority of metabolites in the urine. Specific Populations Gender There is no apparent effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of α-HTBZ or β-HTBZ. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of tetrabenazine was compared in 12 patients with mild to moderate chronic liver impairment (Child-Pugh scores of 5-9) and 12 age- and gender-matched subjects with normal hepatic function who received a single 25 mg dose of tetrabenazine. In patients with hepatic impairment, tetrabenazine plasma concentrations were similar to or higher than concentrations of α-HTBZ, reflecting the markedly decreased metabolism of tetrabenazine to α-HTBZ. The mean tetrabenazine C max in subjects with hepatic impairment was approximately 7- to 190-fold higher than the detectable peak concentrations in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of tetrabenazine in subjects with hepatic impairment was approximately 17.5 hours. The time to peak concentrations (t max ) of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was slightly delayed in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to age-matched controls (1.75 hrs vs. 1.0 hrs), and the elimination half-lives of the α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ were prolonged to approximately 10 and 8 hours, respectively. The exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was approximately 30-39% greater in patients with liver impairment than in age-matched controls. The safety and efficacy of this increased exposure to tetrabenazine and other circulating metabolites are unknown so that it is not possible to adjust the dosage of tetrabenazine in hepatic impairment to ensure safe use. Therefore, Tetrabenazine tablet is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Although the pharmacokinetics of TETRABENAZINE and its metabolites in patients who do not express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6, poor metabolizers, (PMs), have not been systematically evaluated, it is likely that the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ would be increased similar to that observed in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (3- and 9-fold, respectively) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Drug Interactions CYP2D6 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicate that α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are substrates for CYP2D6. The effect of CYP2D6 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of tetrabenazine and its metabolites was studied in 25 healthy subjects following a single 50 mg dose of tetrabenazine given after 10 days of administration of the strong CYP2D6 inhibitor paroxetine 20 mg daily. There was an approximately 30% increase in C max and an approximately 3-fold increase in AUC for α-HTBZ in subjects given paroxetine prior to tetrabenazine compared to tetrabenazine given alone. For β-HTBZ, the C max and AUC were increased 2.4- and 9-fold, respectively, in subjects given paroxetine prior to tetrabenazine given alone. The elimination half-life of α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ was approximately 14 hours when tetrabenazine was given with paroxetine. Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) markedly increase exposure to these metabolites. The effect of moderate or weak CYP2D6 inhibitors such as duloxetine, terbinafine, amiodarone, or sertraline on the exposure to TETRABENAZINE and its metabolites has not been evaluated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Digoxin Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. A study in healthy volunteers showed that Tetrabenazine tablet (25 mg twice daily for 3 days) did not affect the bioavailability of digoxin, suggesting that at this dose, TETRABENAZINE does not affect P-glycoprotein in the intestinal tract. In vitro studies also do not suggest that TETRABENAZINE or its metabolites are P-glycoprotein inhibitors.",
        "dosage": "Individualization of dose with careful weekly titration is required. The 1 st week's starting dose is 12.5 mg daily; 2 nd week, 25 mg (12.5 mg twice daily); then slowly titrate at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg to a tolerated dose that reduces chorea ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Doses of 37.5 mg and up to 50 mg per day should be administered in three divided doses per day with a maximum recommended single dose not to exceed 25 mg ( 2.2 ) Patients requiring doses above 50 mg per day should be genotyped for the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6 to determine if the patient is a poor metabolizer (PM) or an extensive metabolizer (EM). ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Maximum daily dose in PMs: 50 mg with a maximum single dose of 25 mg ( 2.2 ) Maximum daily dose in EMs and intermediate metabolizers (IMs): 100 mg with a maximum single dose of 37.5mg ( 2.2 ) If serious adverse reactions occur, titration should be stopped and the dose should be reduced. If the adverse reaction(s) do not resolve, consider withdrawal of Tetrabenazine tablet ( 2.2 ) 2.1 General Dosing Considerations The chronic daily dose of Tetrabenazine tablet used to treat chorea associated with Huntington's disease (HD) is determined individually for each patient. When first prescribed, Tetrabenazine tablet therapy should be titrated slowly over several weeks to identify a dose of Tetrabenazine tablet that reduces chorea and is tolerated. Tetrabenazine tablet can be administered without regard to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.2 Individualization of Dose The dose of Tetrabenazine tablet should be individualized. Dosing Recommendations Up to 50 mg per day The starting dose should be 12.5 mg per day given once in the morning. After one week, the dose should be increased to 25 mg per day given as 12.5 mg twice a day. Tetrabenazine tablet should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea. If a dose of 37.5 to 50 mg per day is needed, it should be given in a three times a day regimen. The maximum recommended single dose is 25 mg. If adverse reactions such as akathisia, restlessness, parkinsonism, depression, insomnia, anxiety or sedation occur, titration should be stopped and the dose should be reduced. If the adverse reaction does not resolve, consideration should be given to withdrawing Tetrabenazine tablet treatment or initiating other specific treatment (e.g: antidepressants) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Dosing Recommendations Above 50 mg per day Patients who require doses of Tetrabenazine tablet greater than 50 mg per day should be first tested and genotyped to determine if they are poor metabolizers (PMs) or extensive metabolizers (EMs) by their ability to express the drug metabolizing enzyme, CYP2D6. The dose of Tetrabenazine tablet should then be individualized accordingly to their status as PMs or EMs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Extensive and Intermediate CYP2D6 Metabolizers Genotyped patients who are identified as extensive (EMs) or intermediate metabolizers (IMs) of CYP2D6, who need doses of Tetrabenazine tablet above 50 mg per day, should be titrated up slowly at weekly intervals by 12.5 mg daily, to allow the identification of a tolerated dose that reduces chorea. Doses above 50 mg per day should be given in a three times a day regimen. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg and the maximum recommended single dose is 37.5 mg. If adverse reactions such as akathisia, parkinsonism, depression, insomnia, anxiety or sedation occur, titration should be stopped and the dose should be reduced. If the adverse reaction does not resolve, consideration should be given to withdrawing Tetrabenazine tablet treatment or initiating other specific treatment (e.g, antidepressants) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers In PMs, the initial dose and titration is similar to EMs except that the recommended maximum single dose is 25 mg , and the recommended daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.3 Dosage Adjustments with CYP2D6 Inhibitors Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors Medications that are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as quinidine or antidepressants (e.g, fluoxetine, paroxetine) significantly increase the exposure to α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ, therefore, the total dose of Tetrabenazine tablet should not exceed a maximum of 50 mg and the maximum single dose should not exceed 25 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Discontinuation of Treatment Treatment with Tetrabenazine tablet can be discontinued without tapering. Re-emergence of chorea may occur within 12 to 18 hours after the last dose of Tetrabenazine tablet [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ]. 2.5 Resumption of Treatment Following treatment interruption of greater than five (5) days, Tetrabenazine tablet therapy should be re-titrated when resumed. For short-term treatment interruption of less than five (5) days, treatment can be resumed at the previous maintenance dose without titration.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "7.1 Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors In vitro studies indicate that α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are substrates for CYP2D6. Strong CYPD6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) markedly increase exposure to these metabolites. A reduction in Tetrabenazine tablet dose may be necessary when adding a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) in patients maintained on a stable dose of Tetrabenazine tablet. The daily dose of Tetrabenazine tablet should not exceed 50 mg per day and the maximum single dose of Tetrabenazine tablet should not exceed 25 mg in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Population (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 7.2 Reserpine Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2 and the duration of its effect is several days. Prescribers should wait for chorea to reemerge before administering Tetrabenazine tablet to avoid overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the CNS. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting Tetrabenazine tablet. Tetrabenazine tablet and reserpine should not be used concomitantly [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ]. 7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs ) Tetrabenazine tablet is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs. Tetrabenazine tablet should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ]. 7.4 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence. 7.5 Drugs that Cause QTc Prolongation Tetrabenazine tablet causes a small prolongation of QTc (about 8 msec), concomitant use with other drugs that are known to cause QTc prolongation should be avoided, these including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g ., quinidine, procainamide), and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Tetrabenazine tablet should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain conditions may increase the risk for torsade de pointes or sudden death such as, (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 7.6 Neuroleptic Drugs The risk for Parkinsonism, NMS, and akathisia may be increased by concomitant use of Tetrabenazine tablet and dopamine antagonists or antipsychotics (e.g.chlorpromazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, thioridazine, ziprasidone).",

        "dosage": "TABLOID brand Thioguanine is administered orally. The dosage which will be tolerated and effective varies according to the stage and type of neoplastic process being treated. Because the usual therapies for adult and pediatric acute nonlymphocytic leukemias involve the use of thioguanine with other agents in combination, physicians responsible for administering these therapies should be experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapy and in the chosen protocol. Patients with homozygous deficiency of either TPMT or NUDT15 enzyme typically require 10% or less of the standard thioguanine dosage. Reduce initial dosage in patients who are known to have homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency. Most patients with heterozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency tolerate recommended thioguanine doses, but some require dose reduction based on toxicities. Patients who are heterozygous for both TPMT and NUDT15 may require more substantial dosage reductions. Reduce the dosage based on tolerability. Ninety-six (59%) of 163 pediatric patients with previously untreated acute nonlymphocytic leukemia obtained complete remission with a multiple-drug protocol including thioguanine, prednisone, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine. Remission was maintained with daily thioguanine, 4-day pulses of cytarabine and cyclophosphamide, and a single dose of vincristine every 28 days. The median duration of remission was 11.5 months. Fifty-three percent of previously untreated adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemias attained remission following use of the combination of thioguanine and cytarabine according to a protocol developed at The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. A median duration of remission of 8.8 months was achieved with the multiple-drug maintenance regimen which included thioguanine. On those occasions when single-agent chemotherapy with thioguanine may be appropriate, the usual initial dosage for pediatric patients and adults is approximately 2 mg/kg of body weight per day. If, after 4 weeks on this dosage, there is no clinical improvement and no leukocyte or platelet depression, the dosage may be cautiously increased to 3 mg/kg/day. The total daily dose may be given at one time. The dosage of thioguanine used does not depend on whether or not the patient is receiving ZYLOPRIM (allopurinol); this is in contradistinction to the dosage reduction which is mandatory when PURINETHOL ( mercaptopurine ) or IMURAN (azathioprine) is given simultaneously with allopurinol . Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have been published. 1-8 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.",
        "pharmacogenomics": "There is usually complete cross-resistance between PURINETHOL (mercaptopurine) and TABLOID brand Thioguanine. As there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., olsalazine, mesalazine, or sulphasalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, they should be administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent thioguanine therapy (see WARNINGS).",

        "pharmacokinetics": "Vortioxetine pharmacological activity is due to the parent drug. The pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine (2.5 mg to 60 mg) are linear and dose-proportional when vortioxetine is administered once daily. The mean terminal half-life is approximately 66 hours, and steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved within two weeks of dosing. Absorption The maximal plasma vortioxetine concentration (C max ) after dosing is reached within 7 to 11 hours postdose (T max ). Steady-state mean C max values were 9, 18, and 33 ng/mL following doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/day. Absolute bioavailability is 75%. Effect of Food No effect of food on the pharmacokinetics was observed. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of vortioxetine is approximately 2600 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. The plasma protein binding of vortioxetine in humans is 98%, independent of plasma concentrations. No apparent difference in the plasma protein binding between healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic (mild, moderate or severe) or renal (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) impairment is observed. Elimination Metabolism Vortioxetine is extensively metabolized primarily through oxidation via cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2A6, CYP2C8 and CYP2B6 and subsequent glucuronic acid conjugation. CYP2D6 is the primary enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of vortioxetine to its major, pharmacologically inactive, carboxylic acid metabolite, and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 have approximately twice the vortioxetine plasma concentration of extensive metabolizers [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Excretion Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C]-labeled vortioxetine, approximately 59% and 26% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively as metabolites. Negligible amounts of unchanged vortioxetine were excreted in the urine up to 48 hours. The presence of hepatic (mild, moderate or severe) or renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe and ESRD) did not affect the apparent clearance of vortioxetine. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the exposures of vortioxetine were observed based on age, gender, ethnicity, renal function, or hepatic function. The effects of intrinsic patient factors on the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine are presented in Figure 1 . Figure 1.

Impact of Vortioxetine on PK of Other Drugs Figure 3 In Vitro Vortioxetine and its metabolite(s) are unlikely to inhibit the following CYP enzymes and transporter based on in vitro data: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2. As such, no clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized/transported by these CYP enzymes or transporters would be expected. In addition, vortioxetine did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 in an in vitro study in cultured human hepatocytes. Chronic administration of TRINTELLIX is unlikely to induce the metabolism of drugs metabolized by these CYP isoforms. Furthermore, in a series of clinical drug interaction studies, coadministration of TRINTELLIX with substrates for CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropion), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), and CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam), had no clinical meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of these substrates.",

Consider 5 mg/day for patients who do not tolerate higher doses ( 2.1 ). TRINTELLIX can be discontinued abruptly. However, it is recommended that doses of 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day be reduced to 10 mg/day for one week prior to full discontinuation if possible ( 2.3 ). The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg/day in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( 2.5 ). 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose is 10 mg administered orally once daily without regard to meals. Dosage should then be increased to 20 mg/day, as tolerated. The efficacy and safety of doses above 20 mg/day have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. A dose decrease down to 5 mg/day may be considered for patients who do not tolerate higher doses [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . 2.2 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting TRINTELLIX Prior to initiating treatment with TRINTELLIX or another antidepressant, screen patients for personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 2.3 Discontinuing Treatment Although TRINTELLIX can be abruptly discontinued, in placebo-controlled trials patients experienced transient adverse reactions such as headache and muscle tension following abrupt discontinuation of TRINTELLIX 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day. It is recommended that the dose be decreased to 10 mg/day for one week before full discontinuation of TRINTELLIX 15 mg/day or 20 mg/day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 2.4 Switching a Patient to or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with TRINTELLIX to avoid the risk of Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Conversely, at least 21 days must elapse after stopping TRINTELLIX before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders [see Contraindications (4) ] . 2.5 Use of TRINTELLIX in Known CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers or in Patients Taking Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors The maximum recommended dose of TRINTELLIX is 10 mg/day in known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

Coadministration of aspirin 150 mg/day with multiple daily doses of TRINTELLIX had no significant inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation or pharmacokinetics of aspirin and salicylic acid [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Patients receiving other drugs that interfere with hemostasis should be carefully monitored when TRINTELLIX is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Highly Protein Bound Drugs In a clinical study with coadministration of TRINTELLIX (10 mg/day) and warfarin (1 mg/day to 10 mg/day), a highly protein bound drug, no significant change in INR was observed [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Interference with Urine Enzyme Immunoassays for Methadone False positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone have been reported in patients who have taken vortioxetine. An alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) should be considered to confirm positive methadone urine drug screen results.",
